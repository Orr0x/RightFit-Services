## ‚úÖ Recent Update: Sprint 5 Complete - Multi-Channel Notifications

**Sprint 5 Complete (2025-10-29):** All notification features implemented and operational. Email notifications successfully migrated from SendGrid to Resend (3,000 emails/month free vs SendGrid's paid tier). Push notifications, SMS alerts, and automated certificate reminders all tested and working. See **[SPRINT_5_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md](docs/SPRINT_5_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md)** for details.

---

## üìñ Overview

RightFit Services is a comprehensive property maintenance management platform designed specifically for UK landlords. The platform helps landlords manage properties, track work orders, coordinate with contractors, and maintain compliance with UK regulations.

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Multi-Tenant Architecture** - Secure data isolation for multiple landlords
‚úÖ **Property Management** - Add and manage properties with detailed information
‚úÖ **Work Order Tracking** - Create, assign, and track maintenance work orders
‚úÖ **Contractor Management** - Maintain database of contractors and their specialties
‚úÖ **SMS Notifications** - Automatic SMS alerts when work orders are assigned (Twilio)
‚úÖ **Email Notifications** - Certificate expiry reminders with beautiful HTML templates (Resend)
‚úÖ **Push Notifications** - Mobile push notifications for important events (Expo)
‚úÖ **Photo Documentation** - Upload and store property and work order photos (AWS S3)
‚úÖ **Mobile Photo Upload** - Camera/gallery integration with offline queueing
‚úÖ **AI Photo Quality** - Google Vision API checks photo quality (brightness, blur)
‚úÖ **UK Compliance Tracking** - Track certificates (Gas Safety, Electrical, EPC, STL)
‚úÖ **Mobile App** - React Native app fully functional with Expo SDK 54
‚úÖ **Web Dashboard** - React web app for desktop management
‚úÖ **Datetime Scheduling** - Full date and time support for work order scheduling
‚úÖ **Offline Mode** - WatermelonDB local database with automatic sync (requires dev build)

### Core Differentiator

üöÄ **Offline-First Mobile App** - The app works fully offline in rural areas with poor connectivity. Uses WatermelonDB for local data storage with automatic bi-directional sync, conflict resolution, and sync queue management. Changes are automatically synced when connection is restored.

**Note:** Full offline functionality requires a development build (not available in Expo Go). App gracefully degrades to online-only mode when running in Expo Go.

   - Requires: `npx expo prebuild` ‚Üí `npx expo run:ios/android`
   - **Currently blocked by issue #2 above**

4. **Test Coverage Low** - 14.94% coverage (target: 50%+)
5. **No Error Monitoring** - No Sentry or equivalent
6. **No API Rate Limiting** - Only auth endpoints are rate-limited

### Medium Priority
7. **Web App Polish** - Functional but could be more polished
8. **Domain Email Setup** - Currently using Resend's onboarding@resend.dev (custom domain for production)

### Recently Fixed ‚úÖ
- ~~Mobile Auth State~~ - FIXED: AuthContext with AsyncStorage working
- ~~API Base URL~~ - FIXED: Mobile app now uses local IP
- ~~Date-only work orders~~ - FIXED: Full datetime support added
- ~~Offline Mode~~ - FIXED: WatermelonDB + sync service implemented
- ~~Mobile Photo Upload~~ - FIXED: Camera/gallery integration complete
- ~~Test Coverage 0%~~ - FIXED: Now at 14.94% with WorkOrdersService tests
