## ⚠️ Important Notice

**Tech Stack Under Review:** We've identified critical compatibility issues with React 19 and Node.js 24 that are impacting development velocity. See **[TECH_STACK_EVALUATION.md](docs/TECH_STACK_EVALUATION.md)** for detailed analysis and migration recommendations.

## 📖 Overview

RightFit Services is a comprehensive property maintenance management platform designed specifically for UK landlords. The platform helps landlords manage properties, track work orders, coordinate with contractors, and maintain compliance with UK regulations.

### Key Features

✅ **Multi-Tenant Architecture** - Secure data isolation for multiple landlords
✅ **Property Management** - Add and manage properties with detailed information
✅ **Work Order Tracking** - Create, assign, and track maintenance work orders
✅ **Contractor Management** - Maintain database of contractors and their specialties
✅ **SMS Notifications** - Automatic SMS alerts when work orders are assigned (Twilio)
✅ **Photo Documentation** - Upload and store property and work order photos (AWS S3)
✅ **Mobile Photo Upload** - Camera/gallery integration with offline queueing
✅ **AI Photo Quality** - Google Vision API checks photo quality (brightness, blur)
✅ **UK Compliance Tracking** - Track certificates (Gas Safety, Electrical, EPC, STL)
✅ **Mobile App** - React Native app fully functional with Expo SDK 54
✅ **Web Dashboard** - React web app for desktop management
✅ **Datetime Scheduling** - Full date and time support for work order scheduling
✅ **Offline Mode** - WatermelonDB local database with automatic sync (requires dev build)

### Core Differentiator

🚀 **Offline-First Mobile App** - The app works fully offline in rural areas with poor connectivity. Uses WatermelonDB for local data storage with automatic bi-directional sync, conflict resolution, and sync queue management. Changes are automatically synced when connection is restored.

**Note:** Full offline functionality requires a development build (not available in Expo Go). App gracefully degrades to online-only mode when running in Expo Go.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 🔴 Critical
1. **React 19 + Node 24 Compatibility** - Causing development friction and instability
   - React hook errors (multiple React instances)
   - Peer dependency conflicts
   - 150% development time overhead
   - **Action Required:** Review [TECH_STACK_EVALUATION.md](docs/TECH_STACK_EVALUATION.md)

2. **Offline Mode Limitations** - WatermelonDB requires development build
   - Not functional in Expo Go
   - App gracefully degrades but offline features unavailable for testing
   - Requires: `npx expo prebuild` → `npx expo run:ios/android`

### High Priority
3. **Test Coverage Low** - 14.94% coverage (target: 50%+)
4. **No Error Monitoring** - No Sentry or equivalent
5. **No API Rate Limiting** - Only auth endpoints are rate-limited

### Medium Priority
6. **Web App Polish** - Functional but could be more polished
7. **Push Notifications** - Not implemented yet (Sprint 5)

### Recently Fixed ✅
- ~~Mobile Auth State~~ - FIXED: AuthContext with AsyncStorage working
- ~~API Base URL~~ - FIXED: Mobile app now uses local IP
- ~~Date-only work orders~~ - FIXED: Full datetime support added
- ~~Offline Mode~~ - FIXED: WatermelonDB + sync service implemented
- ~~Mobile Photo Upload~~ - FIXED: Camera/gallery integration complete
- ~~Test Coverage 0%~~ - FIXED: Now at 14.94% with WorkOrdersService tests

**Full list:** See `HANDOVER.md` section "Known Issues"
