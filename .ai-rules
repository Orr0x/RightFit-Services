# AI Assistant Rules

## CRITICAL - READ FIRST

### Context-Aware Server Management:

**DURING ACTIVE SESSION (human present):**
- ❌ DO NOT start/stop servers - human manages them
- ❌ DO NOT install packages - ask first
- ❌ DO NOT run migrations - ask first
- ✅ Suggest commands, human runs them

**WHEN HUMAN IS AWAY (gone to bed, not responding):**
- ✅ CAN start/stop servers for autonomous work
- ✅ CAN run tests and commands
- ✅ CAN kill stuck processes
- ✅ MUST document everything done
- ❌ Still NO package installs or migrations without prior approval

### How to Tell Human Is Away?
- Human says "gone to bed", "see you tomorrow", "stepping away"
- No response for 30+ minutes
- End of work day (typically after 10pm)

### ✅ WHAT YOU CAN ALWAYS DO:
- Read any file
- Write/edit code files
- Create documentation
- Analyze code
- Search codebase
- Generate code examples

### 📋 WORKFLOW:

**Active Session:**
1. AI writes code
2. Human runs/tests code
3. AI analyzes results
4. Repeat

**Autonomous Work:**
1. AI writes code
2. AI runs/tests code
3. AI documents results
4. Human reviews when back
