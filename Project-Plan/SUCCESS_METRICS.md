# Success Metrics - RightFit Services
## Defining "Best-in-Class" Quality

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30
**Purpose:** Measurable criteria for quality-first development
**Philosophy:** "Success = Lodge managers recommend RightFit Services unprompted"
**Status:** Active - Track progress weekly

---

## Core Principle

**We build something so good that lodge managers can't help but tell other lodge managers about it.**

This means:
- Technical excellence (reliable, fast, secure)
- User experience excellence (delightful, intuitive, helpful)
- Competitive differentiation (features competitors don't have)
- Product-market fit (solves real pain, saves real time)

---

## Success Metrics by Category

## 1. Technical Excellence

### Test Coverage
**Current:** 14.94% (38 passing tests)
**Target:** ≥70% overall coverage

**Breakdown Targets:**
- Backend Services: ≥80% coverage
- API Endpoints: ≥70% coverage (integration tests)
- Frontend Components: ≥60% coverage
- Critical paths: ≥90% coverage (auth, multi-tenancy, payments)

**How We Measure:**
- Jest coverage reports (backend + frontend)
- CI/CD pipeline enforces minimum thresholds
- Coverage trends tracked weekly

**Why It Matters:**
- High test coverage = fewer production bugs
- Confidence to refactor and add features
- Faster development velocity long-term

---

### API Performance
**Current:** Not benchmarked
**Target:** <500ms response time (95th percentile)

**Breakdown Targets:**
- GET endpoints: <300ms (p95)
- POST/PATCH endpoints: <500ms (p95)
- File uploads: <2s for 5MB photo
- Search queries: <1s (p95)

**How We Measure:**
- API monitoring (New Relic, DataDog, or similar)
- Synthetic monitoring (regular test requests)
- Real user monitoring (RUM)

**Why It Matters:**
- Fast API = responsive UI
- Lodge managers are busy, no time to wait
- Competitive advantage (many competitors are slow)

---

### Uptime & Reliability
**Current:** Not in production yet
**Target:** ≥99.9% uptime (43 minutes downtime/month max)

**Breakdown Targets:**
- Planned maintenance: <1 hour/month (scheduled)
- Unplanned downtime: <30 minutes/month
- Database availability: ≥99.95%
- S3 availability: ≥99.99% (AWS SLA)

**How We Measure:**
- UptimeRobot or similar monitoring
- AWS CloudWatch for infrastructure
- Incident tracking and post-mortems

**Why It Matters:**
- Downtime = emergency repairs delayed
- Guest issues can't be reported if system is down
- Reliability builds trust

---

### Security
**Current:** Basic security (JWT, Helmet, rate limiting on auth)
**Target:** Zero critical vulnerabilities

**Breakdown Targets:**
- OWASP Top 10: All mitigated
- Penetration test: No critical or high findings
- Dependency vulnerabilities: Auto-patched within 7 days
- Security headers: A+ rating (securityheaders.com)
- Rate limiting: All endpoints protected

**How We Measure:**
- OWASP ZAP automated scans
- Manual penetration testing
- Snyk or Dependabot for dependency scanning
- Security audit quarterly

**Why It Matters:**
- Customer data must be protected (GDPR compliance)
- Multi-tenancy isolation is security-critical
- Breach = business over for small company

---

- Smooth app = more usage

---

## 2. User Experience Excellence

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)
**Current:** Not measured (no users yet)
**Target:** ≥50 (World-class NPS)

- Target: 50+ (Apple is 72, most SaaS is 30-40)

**How We Measure:**
- In-app survey after 30 days of use
- Email survey after job completion
- Quarterly NPS surveys

**Why It Matters:**
- NPS predicts growth (promoters = free marketing)
- High NPS = product-market fit
- Detractors tell us what to fix
