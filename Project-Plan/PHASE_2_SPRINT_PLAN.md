# Phase 2 Sprint Plan: UX Excellence
## RightFit Services - Delightful User Experience

**Sprint Duration:** 4 weeks (28 days)
**Dates:** Weeks 4-7 of Quality Roadmap
**Sprint Goal:** Transform functional UI into delightful user experience
**Total Story Points:** 112 points (~28 points/week)
**Team Capacity:** 1 developer, 30-40 hours/week

**Created:** 2025-10-30
**Product Owner:** Sarah (PO Agent)
**Status:** ✅ READY (Pending Phase 1 Completion)

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goal

**Transform "functional but basic" into "delightful to use":**
- Design system: None → Complete design language
- Loading states: Missing → All screens
- Mobile UX: Basic → Polished with animations
- Accessibility: Unknown → Lighthouse 90+
- Dark mode: None → Fully supported

**Why This Matters:**
UX is how users judge quality. A polished interface makes users trust the platform and recommend it unprompted.
