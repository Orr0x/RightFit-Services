## 3. Gap Analysis Summary

| Area | Documentation Claim | Actual State | Status |
|------|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| **Design System** | Complete ✅ | Complete ✅ | ✅ ACCURATE |
| **Component Library** | Complete ✅ | Complete ✅ (29 components) | ✅ ACCURATE |
| **Web App Integration** | Complete ✅ | **Complete ✅ (6/6 pages)** | ✅ **BETTER THAN EXPECTED** |
| **Mobile App Integration** | Complete ✅ | **Not Started ❌ (0/10+ screens)** | ❌ **CRITICAL GAP** |
| **Offline Sync** | Working ✅ | Working ✅ | ✅ ACCURATE |
| **Linux Environment** | Working ✅ | Working ✅ | ✅ ACCURATE |

### Key Finding:

The web app is **fully migrated** (100%), which is better than expected from "some ui work done". However, the mobile app is **completely untouched** (0%), confirming user's statement exactly.

## 5. What Needs to Happen Next

Based on user's stated priority:
> "once the mobile app has matching formatting, look and feel as the updated web app, we can move onto building out the new wireframes"

### Immediate Priority: Mobile App Design System Migration

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks (40 story points)

#### Step 1: Build React Native Component Library (5-7 days)

**Create:** [apps/mobile/src/components/ui/](apps/mobile/src/components/ui/)

Components needed (matching web):
- Button (primary, secondary, ghost, danger variants)
- Input (text, email, password, number types)
- Card (flat, elevated variants)
- Modal (with sizes)
- Spinner (loading indicators)
- EmptyState
- Toast notifications (React Native equivalent)

**Convert design tokens:**
- [apps/mobile/src/styles/design-tokens.ts](apps/mobile/src/styles/design-tokens.ts)
- Convert CSS variables → React Native StyleSheet constants
- Colors, typography, spacing, shadows

#### Step 2: Migrate Mobile Screens (7-10 days)

**Priority order (based on usage):**
1. PropertiesListScreen - Replace React Native Paper → Design system
2. WorkOrdersListScreen - Replace React Native Paper → Design system
3. PropertyDetailsScreen
4. WorkOrderDetailsScreen
5. CreatePropertyScreen
6. CreateWorkOrderScreen
7. ProfileScreen
8. LoginScreen/RegisterScreen
9. DebugScreen

**For each screen:**
- Replace React Native Paper imports with custom components
- Apply design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Replace hardcoded colors with token values
- Test offline sync still works
- Visual QA on emulator and physical device

#### Step 3: Testing & QA (2-3 days)

- Test all screens on Android emulator
- Test on physical device
- Verify offline mode still works with new components
- Verify sync functionality
- Performance testing (app startup time)
- Visual consistency check (mobile matches web)

---

## 6. Then: Build New Wireframes

After mobile app matches web app design, proceed with:

**Phase 2 Week 5-7 Tasks:**
- Responsive polish (Week 5, 28 points)
- Dark mode (Week 6, 16 points)
- Animations & micro-interactions (Week 7, 12 points)

**New Wireframe Implementation (Phase 3):**
- Service provider dashboard (Cleaning Services view)
- Service provider dashboard (Maintenance Services view)
- Cross-sell workflow UI
- Customer portal views
- Guest self-service dashboard

---

## 7. Technical Debt Identified

### TD-NEW-1: Mobile Design System Not Created (Priority: P0 - Critical)

**Issue:** Mobile app still uses React Native Paper, no design system integration
**Impact:**
- Visual inconsistency between web and mobile
- Cannot implement new wireframes on mobile
- Technical debt compounds as web evolves
**Effort:** 40 story points (2-3 weeks)
**Owner:** TBD
**Status:** Not Started

### TD-NEW-2: Design Token Conversion (Priority: P1 - High)

**Issue:** Design tokens exist only for web (CSS variables), need React Native equivalent
**Impact:**
- Cannot reuse color/spacing/typography values on mobile
- Hardcoded values throughout mobile app
**Effort:** 3 story points (1 day)
**Owner:** TBD
**Status:** Not Started

### TD-NEW-3: Mobile Loading/Empty States (Priority: P1 - High)

**Issue:** Mobile screens have basic loading/empty states, not matching web polish
**Impact:**
- Inconsistent UX between platforms
- Mobile feels less polished than web
**Effort:** 5 story points (2 days)
**Owner:** TBD
**Status:** Not Started

---

## 8. Documentation Updates Needed

1. **Update PHASE_2_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md:**
   - Split Week 4 into "Web" and "Mobile" tracks
   - Mark Web as 100% complete ✅
   - Mark Mobile as 0% complete ❌
   - Add 40 points for mobile integration work
   - Adjust Phase 2 total: 56/152 points (37%)

2. **Create MOBILE_DESIGN_SYSTEM_PLAN.md:**
   - Component library requirements
   - Design token conversion strategy
   - Screen-by-screen migration checklist
   - Testing plan for offline sync
   - Timeline: 2-3 weeks

3. **Update CURRENT_STATE.md:**
   - Web app: ALL pages migrated ✅
   - Mobile app: NOT migrated ❌
   - Next step: Mobile design system (40 points)

4. **Update TECHNICAL_DEBT_REGISTER.md:**
   - Add TD-NEW-1, TD-NEW-2, TD-NEW-3
   - Mark as blocking for new wireframe work

---

## 9. Recommended Next Actions

### For Development:

**Option A: Mobile-First (User's Preferred Path)**
```
Week 1: Build React Native component library + design tokens
Week 2: Migrate core screens (Properties, WorkOrders)
Week 3: Migrate remaining screens + testing
Week 4+: Build new wireframes (web + mobile in parallel)
```

**Option B: New Wireframes for Web First**
```
Week 1-2: Build new wireframes for web app only
Week 3-4: Build mobile design system
Week 5-6: Migrate mobile screens
Week 7+: Build mobile wireframes
```

**Recommended:** **Option A** (matches user's stated priority)

### For Documentation:

1. Read this document to understand current state
2. Update PHASE_2_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md with findings
3. Create MOBILE_DESIGN_SYSTEM_PLAN.md
4. Update TECHNICAL_DEBT_REGISTER.md with new items

---

## 10. Success Criteria for "Mobile Matches Web"

Before moving to new wireframes, verify:

✅ All mobile screens use custom design system components (not React Native Paper)
✅ Design tokens applied consistently (colors, spacing, typography)
✅ Loading states match web (Spinner, Skeleton)
✅ Empty states match web (EmptyState component)
✅ Modals/Dialogs match web styling
✅ Buttons/Inputs match web variants
✅ Offline sync still works with new components
✅ Visual consistency: Mobile feels like same app as web
✅ Performance: <100ms app startup time maintained
✅ Testing: All screens tested on emulator + physical device
