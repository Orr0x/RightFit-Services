## üéØ Your Mission

Complete 6 user stories to finish Phase 2 (UX Excellence) and implement the new service provider platform.

**Timeline:** 6 weeks (150 story points @ ~25 points/week)

---

## üìã What You Need to Do

### 1. Read the README First

Open and read: [stories/README.md](README.md)

This explains:
- How the story folder works
- Git workflow basics
- Story format
- Important rules

**‚è±Ô∏è Time: 10 minutes**

---

### 2. Review Git Workflow

This shows you:
- How to create feature branches
- How to commit and push
- What to do when complete
- Troubleshooting

**‚è±Ô∏è Time: 15 minutes**

---

### 3. Understand Current State

Read these for context (optional but recommended):

- [Project-Plan/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](../Project-Plan/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md) - Quick overview
- [Project-Plan/CURRENT_STATE_VERIFIED.md](../Project-Plan/CURRENT_STATE_VERIFIED.md) - What's done vs not done
- [Project-Plan/PHASE_2_SPRINT_PLAN.md](../Project-Plan/PHASE_2_SPRINT_PLAN.md) - Overall plan

**‚è±Ô∏è Time: 20 minutes** (or skim quickly)

---

### 4. Start STORY-001

**This is where you begin coding.**

Open: [phase-2/STORY-001-week-5-web-ux-polish.md](phase-2/STORY-001-week-5-web-ux-polish.md)

Read the entire story, then:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/story-001-week-5-web-ux

# Start working on Part 1: Form UX Improvements
```

**‚è±Ô∏è Duration: 5-7 days**

---

### 5. Continue Through Stories in Order

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Rules

### Rule 1: Never Delete .md Files

‚ùå **DO NOT DELETE:**
- Any story file
- Any documentation
- Any markdown file

‚úÖ **Instead:**
- Mark stories as complete in the file
- Archive old files to `completed/` folder
- Never permanently delete

**Why?** These files are the project's memory and documentation.

---

### Rule 2: Always Work in Order

‚ùå **DO NOT:**
- Skip STORY-002 and jump to STORY-003
- Work on multiple stories simultaneously
- Work out of sequence

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Complete STORY-001 fully before starting STORY-002
- Complete STORY-002 fully before starting STORY-003
- And so on...

**Why?** Later stories depend on earlier ones being complete.

---

### Rule 3: Always Use Feature Branches

‚ùå **DO NOT:**
- Work directly on `main` branch
- Commit to `main`
- Push to `main`

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Create a feature branch for each story
- Use exact branch name from story
- Example: `feature/story-001-week-5-web-ux`

**Why?** Keeps main branch stable and allows for code review.

---

### Rule 4: Commit and Push Frequently

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Commit multiple times per day
- Push to your feature branch daily
- Reference story ID in commit messages

**Example:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add inline form validation (STORY-001)"
git push origin feature/story-001-week-5-web-ux
```

**Why?** Frequent commits = backup + progress tracking.

---

### Rule 5: Update Story Files as You Work

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Check off tasks as you complete them
- Update story status when done
- Commit story file changes

**Example:**
```bash
# In STORY-001 file, change:
- [ ] Add inline validation

# To:
- [x] Add inline validation

# Then commit
git add stories/phase-2/STORY-001-week-5-web-ux-polish.md
git commit -m "docs: update STORY-001 checklist (STORY-001)"
git push origin feature/story-001-week-5-web-ux
```

**Why?** Shows progress and prevents forgetting what's done.
