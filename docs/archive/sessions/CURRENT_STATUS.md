## 🎉 Recent Accomplishments

### Session Summary (2025-10-28)

This session focused on fixing critical mobile app bugs and adding datetime scheduling support. All major blockers have been resolved and the mobile app is now fully functional.

#### ✅ Mobile App Fully Operational
**Achievement:** Mobile app works end-to-end on physical devices

**Fixed Issues:**
1. **Authentication State** - AuthContext with AsyncStorage token persistence working
2. **Network Configuration** - API URL changed from localhost to local IP (192.168.0.17:3001)
3. **Work Order Crashes** - Added null safety for estimated_cost, property, and contractor fields
4. **Expo SDK Compatibility** - Disabled New Architecture, using Legacy Architecture mode

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Login/Register working
- ✅ Properties list, details, and create working
- ✅ Work orders list, details, and create working
- ✅ Profile and logout working
- ✅ Auth state persists across app restarts
- ✅ App works on physical devices over local network

#### ✅ Datetime Scheduling Feature
**Achievement:** Both web and mobile support full date and time for work orders

**Web Changes:**
- Changed from `date` input to `datetime-local` input
- Displays: `DD/MM/YYYY, HH:MM`
- Resolved console warnings about date format

**Mobile Changes:**
- Added datetime field to CreateWorkOrderScreen
- Format guidance: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (e.g., "2025-01-15 14:30")
- Updated details screen to show date and time
- Also added estimated cost field

**Rationale:**
- Jobs are often 2-3 hours (not full days)
- Enables precise contractor scheduling
- Better coordination with tenants for access

#### ✅ GitHub Repository Setup
**Achievement:** Complete codebase backed up to GitHub

- Repository: https://github.com/Orr0x/RightFit-Services (public)
- All code pushed to main branch
- 165 files, 58,652+ lines of code
- Full documentation included (docs/ folder)
- Proper .gitignore configured

## 🎯 What's Next

### Immediate Priorities (Next Session)

#### 1. Testing & Quality (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Why:** 0% test coverage is risky for production

**Tasks:**
- Add unit tests for AuthService (registration, login, multi-tenancy)
- Add unit tests for PropertiesService (CRUD, tenant filtering)
- Add integration tests for critical API endpoints
- Test multi-tenancy data isolation thoroughly

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days
**Story Points:** 13 points

#### 2. Offline Mode - Sprint 4 (CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATOR)
**Why:** Core value proposition for rural areas

**Tasks:**
- Integrate WatermelonDB for local database
- Implement sync queue with conflict resolution
- Add offline indicators in UI
- Test offline create/update/delete
- Test sync when connection restored

**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days
**Story Points:** 56 points

#### 3. Mobile Photo Upload (DEFERRED FROM SPRINT 3)
**Why:** Important for property documentation

**Tasks:**
- Implement expo-image-picker
- Add camera permission handling
- Create photo upload screen for work orders
- Add photo gallery view in mobile app

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days
**Story Points:** 10 points

#### 4. Push Notifications (SPRINT 5 COMPLETION)
**Why:** Keep contractors and landlords informed

**Tasks:**
- Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Implement push notification service
- Add notification permissions handling
- Send notifications on work order assignment
- Send reminders for expiring certificates

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days
**Story Points:** 18 points

## 🚀 Sprint Plan Recommendation

### Option 1: Quality First (Recommended)
**Priority:** Stability and reliability before new features

**Week 1:**
- Day 1-2: Unit testing (AuthService, PropertiesService)
- Day 3-4: Mobile photo upload feature
- Day 5: Integration testing and bug fixes

**Week 2:**
- Day 1-5: Begin Sprint 4 (Offline mode - Part 1)

**Rationale:** Tests prevent regressions and give confidence for offline mode

### Option 2: Feature First
**Priority:** Complete core features quickly

**Week 1:**
- Day 1-3: Mobile photo upload
- Day 4-5: Begin Sprint 4 (Offline mode)

**Week 2:**
- Day 1-5: Continue Sprint 4 (Offline mode)
- Add tests incrementally

**Rationale:** Ship features faster, test later

### Option 3: MVP Rush
**Priority:** Get to market ASAP

**Week 1-2:**
- Complete Sprint 4 (Offline mode)
- Skip tests initially
- Focus on core user workflows

**Week 3:**
- Sprint 5 completion (Push notifications)
- Begin Sprint 6 (Payments + launch prep)

**Rationale:** Validate market need before over-engineering

## 💻 Technical Debt & Considerations

### Current Technical Debt
1. **No Tests** - 0% coverage, high risk
2. **No Error Monitoring** - No Sentry or equivalent
3. **API Rate Limiting** - Only auth endpoints protected
4. **No API Documentation** - No Swagger/OpenAPI spec
5. **Photo Storage** - Using local filesystem, not S3 yet
6. **No CI/CD** - Manual deployment process

### Architecture Decisions Needed

#### Should we migrate photo storage to S3 now?
**Current:** Photos stored in `apps/api/uploads/` (works but not scalable)
**Pros of migrating now:** Better for production, CDN support
**Cons:** Adds complexity, needs AWS setup
**Recommendation:** Wait until post-MVP unless storage becomes an issue

#### Should we implement full S3 or use local storage for MVP?
**Option 1:** Full S3 with CloudFront CDN
**Option 2:** Local filesystem with nginx
**Option 3:** Hybrid (local for dev, S3 for production)
**Recommendation:** Option 3 - keeps dev simple, production ready

#### How should offline sync handle conflicts?
**Strategy 1:** Last-write-wins (simple but data loss risk)
**Strategy 2:** Manual conflict resolution (complex UX)
**Strategy 3:** Operational transformation (complex to implement)
**Recommendation:** Start with Strategy 1, add Strategy 2 if needed

## 🔧 Developer Environment

### Current Setup Working
```bash
# API Server (Terminal 1)
cd apps/api
pnpm run dev
# Running on http://192.168.0.17:3001

# Web App (Terminal 2)
cd apps/web
pnpm run dev

cd apps/mobile
pnpm start
# Expo running on http://localhost:8081
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app

# Database (Docker container already running)
# PostgreSQL on port 5433:5432
```

### Mobile App Configuration
**Important:** Mobile app is configured for local network testing

- API_BASE_URL: `http://192.168.0.17:3001`
- Works on physical devices over WiFi
- Expo SDK 54 with Legacy Architecture
- React 19.1.0 + React Native 0.81.4

**To change IP address:**

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Mobile Development Insights

1. **Expo New Architecture:** Not production-ready yet
   - Disabled `newArchEnabled` to use Legacy Architecture
   - More stable, better compatibility with SDK 54

2. **Network Configuration:** Localhost doesn't work on physical devices
   - Always use local IP for mobile development
   - Consider environment variables for different environments

3. **Token Storage:** AsyncStorage works well for JWT tokens
   - Persist tokens on login/register
   - Restore auth state on app launch
   - Handle token refresh gracefully

4. **Null Safety:** Always check for undefined/null in mobile screens
   - API may return sparse data
   - Database fields may be nullable
   - Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing

### General Development Insights

1. **Git Hygiene:** Keep .gitignore comprehensive
   - Exclude AI tool folders (.claude, .goose, etc.)
   - Never commit .env files
   - Clean up temp files before committing

2. **Documentation:** Update docs as you code
   - README stays current
   - SPRINT_STATUS tracks progress
   - Makes handoffs easier

3. **Testing Philosophy:** Should have started earlier
   - 0% coverage makes refactoring scary
   - Tests document expected behavior
   - Start with critical paths first

## ✅ Decision Required

**You need to decide:** What should be the priority for the next session?

### A. Testing & Quality (Recommended for stability)
Focus on unit tests and fixing technical debt before building more features.

### B. Offline Mode (Recommended for differentiation)
The core value proposition - get this working to validate MVP concept.

### C. Mobile Photos (Quickest win)
Complete deferred Sprint 3 story, gives users more functionality.

### D. MVP Rush (Fastest to market)
Skip tests, focus on completing all features, launch ASAP with beta users.

**My Recommendation:** **Option B (Offline Mode)** with concurrent **Option A (Testing)**
- Offline mode is the core differentiator
- Add tests incrementally while building offline features
- This balances speed with quality

**Status:** ✅ Ready for next session
**Blockers:** None
**Next Developer Action:** Choose priority and begin implementation
