# Product Owner Discovery Document
## RightFit Services - MVP Requirements Foundation

**Document Version:** 2.0 (REVISED FOR SOLO DEVELOPER)
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Prepared by:** Business Analyst (Mary)
**For:** Product Owner (PO)
**Status:** Updated for Solo Developer Bootstrap - Ready for PRD Development

---

## **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR PO**

**REVISED STRATEGY (Solo Developer Bootstrap):**
- **Primary Target:** Long-term landlords (1-20 properties), NOT cabin owners
- **Pricing:** Â£15-25/month competitive pricing (NOT Â£50-75 premium)
- **Timeline:** 3-month MVP development by solo developer
- **Budget:** MINIMAL (Â£2k-5k for MVP)
- **Positioning:** "Arthur Online reliability without the outages, at half the price"
- **Scope:** RUTHLESSLY CUT features - see updated MVP scope below

**What Changed:**
- Broader market (long-term landlords = 4.6M households vs. 5-10k cabins)
- Competitive pricing strategy (undercut Arthur Online, compete with Landlord Studio/PaTMa)
- Solo developer constraints (no team, minimal budget, 3-month timeline)
- UK-wide SaaS from day 1 (not Scotland-first)

**What Stays:**
- Mobile-first with offline functionality (core differentiator)
- Work order management + contractor database (core features)
- Basic AI photo quality checks (unique at this price point)
- UK compliance tracking (Gas Safety, Electrical, EPC reminders)

## User Personas & Jobs-to-Be-Done

### Persona 1: Jamie - Cabin Owner in Scottish Highlands

**Demographics:**
- Age: 42
- Location: Scottish Highlands (manages 3 cabins remotely from Edinburgh)
- Tech Comfort: High (uses Airbnb, online banking, but frustrated by complex software)
- Annual Revenue: Â£75k from cabin rentals

**Current Tools:**
- Airbnb for bookings
- Spreadsheets for cleaning schedules
- Phone/email for contractor coordination
- Paper files for compliance certificates

**Pain Points:**
- Drives 2 hours to properties for inspections (no reliable remote verification)
- Missed gas certificate renewal (nearly fined Â£2,500 under Scottish STL licensing)
- Cleaner reported broken window lock but didn't notify maintenance until Jamie's next visit
- No mobile signal at cabins makes real-time coordination impossible
- Struggles to find contractors willing to travel to remote properties

**Jobs-to-Be-Done:**
1. **When** I receive a booking, **I want to** automatically schedule cleaning and pre-arrival inspection, **so that** the cabin is guest-ready without manual coordination
2. **When** I'm at the property doing maintenance, **I want to** create work orders and take photos even without mobile signal, **so that** I don't have to remember tasks when I get back to civilization
3. **When** a compliance certificate is expiring, **I want to** receive reminders 60 days and 30 days in advance, **so that** I never risk a Â£2,500 fine again
4. **When** a cleaner finds an issue during turnover, **I want to** be immediately alerted and able to dispatch a contractor, **so that** problems are fixed before guest check-in
5. **When** winter arrives, **I want to** follow a seasonal winterization checklist, **so that** I don't forget critical tasks like draining pipes and stocking firewood

**Success Metrics:**
- Reduce property visits from 12/year to 4/year (save Â£1,600 in travel costs)
- Zero missed compliance deadlines
- Fix 90% of cleaner-reported issues before guest arrival (vs. 40% currently)

### Persona 2: Sarah - Professional Cleaning Company Owner

**Demographics:**
- Age: 35
- Location: Edinburgh
- Company: CleanStay Scotland (8 employees, serving 45 STR properties)
- Tech Comfort: Moderate (uses WhatsApp, Google Sheets, email)
- Annual Revenue: Â£120k

**Current Tools:**
- Google Sheets for scheduling
- WhatsApp for team coordination
- Manual invoices via Word + email
- Separate spreadsheet for payment tracking per client

**Pain Points:**
- Spends 15 hours/week on admin (invoicing, scheduling, payment follow-ups)
- Creates 50-60 individual invoices per month (one per clean per property)
- Can't demonstrate SLA performance to win larger contracts
- Manual WhatsApp coordination means double-bookings and missed jobs
- Property managers demand accountability but no system to show proof of quality

**Jobs-to-Be-Done:**
1. **When** I receive cleaning requests from multiple properties, **I want to** batch schedule my team across the week with automatic assignments, **so that** I don't spend hours manually coordinating via WhatsApp
2. **When** a clean is completed, **I want to** my cleaner to upload verification photos automatically, **so that** I can prove quality to property managers without manual follow-up
3. **When** invoicing time comes, **I want to** generate batch invoices for all cleans per client for the month, **so that** I save 10+ hours on individual invoicing
4. **When** a property manager asks about my SLA performance, **I want to** show transparent metrics (on-time rate, quality scores, response time), **so that** I can win premium contracts
5. **When** a team member calls in sick, **I want to** quickly reassign jobs to available cleaners, **so that** I meet my 24-hour backup guarantee

**Success Metrics:**
- Reduce admin time from 15 hours/week to 5 hours/week (10 hours saved = Â£5k/year value)
- Win 2-3 larger contracts (20+ properties) due to SLA performance transparency
- Increase team utilization from 70% to 85% through better scheduling

### Persona 3: Mark - First-Time STR Landlord (Secondary Persona)

**Demographics:**
- Age: 38
- Location: Lake District (manages 1 cottage, considering buying 2nd)
- Tech Comfort: Moderate (comfortable with apps, but not technical)
- Annual Revenue: Â£18k from cottage rental (side income, keeps day job)

**Current Tools:**
- Booking.com for listings
- Paper notebook for maintenance tracking
- Local handyman on speed dial
- Individual cleaner booked via text message

**Pain Points:**
- Forgets maintenance tasks (last EPC expired, only realized when guest complained about heating efficiency rating)
- Can't tell if cleaner did thorough job unless he drives 45 minutes to check in person
- Tracks expenses in notebook, creates tax return stress every April
- Unsure which maintenance tasks are legally required vs. optional

**Jobs-to-Be-Done:**
1. **When** I list my cottage on multiple platforms, **I want to** see all bookings in one calendar, **so that** I don't double-book or miss cleanings
2. **When** a guest reports an issue during their stay, **I want to** quickly create a work order and assign to my handyman from my phone, **so that** I can fix problems without disrupting my day job
3. **When** my cleaner finishes a turnover, **I want to** see photos of the cottage so I know it's guest-ready, **so that** I don't have to drive 45 minutes to check
4. **When** tax time approaches, **I want to** see all income and expenses automatically categorized, **so that** I can file my tax return without stress
5. **When** starting out, **I want to** guidance on what compliance certificates I legally need, **so that** I don't accidentally break the law

**Success Metrics:**
- Reduce stress and time spent on property management (enable scaling to 2nd property)
- Zero guest complaints about cleanliness or maintenance issues
- Cut tax prep time from 8 hours to 2 hours

## Questions Requiring PO Decision Before Development

### 1. Pricing & Business Model

**Question:** What is the pricing structure for MVP?
**Options:**
- **Option A:** Flat monthly fee per property manager (e.g., Â£25/month for 1-10 properties, Â£50/month for 11-50 properties)
- **Option B:** Per-property pricing (e.g., Â£5/property/month, similar to Turno/Breezeway)
- **Option C:** Freemium (free for 1 property, paid for additional properties)
- **Option D:** Free during MVP beta (6 months), then paid

**Recommendation:** Option D (free beta) to maximize feedback and iteration speed, then transition to Option A (flat fee Â£25-50/month) based on value delivered

---

### 2. Contractor Accounts & Marketplace

**Question:** Should contractors have free accounts in MVP, or is this Phase 2?
**Options:**
- **Option A:** Yes, contractors can create free accounts in MVP (receive notifications, update work orders via mobile app)
- **Option B:** No, contractors are just entries in property manager's database (no login, no app access) - simpler MVP

**Recommendation:** Option A - Contractor accounts add significant value (photo uploads, status updates) and differentiate from competitors. Low development cost with React Native code sharing.

---

### 3. Tenant Portal Priority

**Question:** Is tenant portal truly MVP, or can it be deprioritized to Phase 2?
**Context:** Industry data shows 19% UK tenant portal adoption. Development cost ~2-3 weeks. Value is moderate.
**Options:**
- **Option A:** Include basic tenant portal in MVP (maintenance requests, payment view, document access)
- **Option B:** Deprioritize to Phase 2, focus MVP on property manager + contractor workflows

**Recommendation:** Option B - Deprioritize tenant portal to Phase 2. MVP should nail property manager experience first. Tenants can report issues via phone/email/WhatsApp in MVP.

---

### 4. AI Photo Verification Accuracy Threshold

**Question:** What accuracy level is "good enough" for MVP basic quality checks?
**Context:** Google Vision API can detect basic issues (too dark, too blurry) with ~85-90% accuracy. Custom models (Phase 2) can reach 95%+.
**Options:**
- **Option A:** Target 80%+ accuracy (acceptable for MVP, users understand it's helping, not perfect)
- **Option B:** Target 90%+ accuracy (requires more complex logic, longer development)
- **Option C:** No specific target, just implement basic checks and iterate based on user feedback

**Recommendation:** Option C - Implement basic checks (brightness, blur, content detection), collect user feedback and false positive/negative data, iterate in Phase 2.

---

### 5. Offline Functionality Depth

**Question:** How much offline functionality is truly needed for MVP?
**Options:**
- **Option A:** Full offline mode (create work orders, update status, upload photos, complete cleanings - all queued for sync)
- **Option B:** Read-only offline (view cached data, but cannot create/edit - graceful degradation)
- **Option C:** No offline support in MVP (error message: "No internet connection, please try again later")

**Recommendation:** Option A - Full offline mode is critical differentiator for rural property use case (Jamie persona). React Native supports offline well with libraries like Redux Persist or WatermelonDB. Extra complexity worth it for target market.

---

### 6. Cleaning Company B2B Features

**Question:** Should we include any B2B features for cleaning companies in MVP, or wait for Phase 2?
**Context:** Batch invoicing, team dispatch, SLA tracking identified as major gaps. Development cost ~3-4 weeks.
**Options:**
- **Option A:** Include in MVP as separate module (cleaning companies can sign up, property managers can hire them)
- **Option B:** Phase 2 only, MVP focuses on property manager hiring individual cleaners

**Recommendation:** Option B - Phase 2 only. MVP should validate property manager workflows first. Adding two-sided marketplace prematurely risks chicken-and-egg problem and delays launch.

---

### 7. Scottish STL Compliance Fields

**Question:** What specific fields/features are required for Scottish STL licensing compliance?
**Context:** Research indicates mandatory licensing, but exact platform requirements need legal validation.
**Action Required:** Interview Scottish property lawyer or consult Scottish STL licensing authority to define:
- Required certificate fields (license number, issue date, expiration)
- Renewal reminder timing (60 days before expiration? 90 days?)
- Additional compliance requirements (fire risk assessments, public liability insurance tracking)

**Recommendation:** Conduct legal research before finalizing property profile and compliance tracking fields. Can launch MVP without Scotland-specific features, add in Phase 2 after validation.

---

### 8. Platform Launch Geography

**Question:** Should we launch UK-wide or Scotland-only for MVP?
**Options:**
- **Option A:** Scotland-only (focused marketing, Scottish STL compliance as wedge)
- **Option B:** UK-wide (larger market, but less targeted positioning)
- **Option C:** Scottish Highlands + Lake District (two highest-value cabin markets)

**Recommendation:** Option C - Launch in Scottish Highlands and Lake District simultaneously. Target cabin/lodge owners specifically. Expand to rest of UK in Phase 2 after product-market fit proven.

---

### 9. Multi-Platform Launch Sequence

**Question:** Launch iOS + Android + Web simultaneously, or sequence?
**Context:** React Native allows simultaneous iOS/Android development. Web app is separate React codebase.
**Options:**
- **Option A:** Simultaneous launch (iOS, Android, Web) - maximum reach, but 4-6 weeks extra development
- **Option B:** Mobile first (iOS + Android), web 4-6 weeks later
- **Option C:** iOS first (Scotland has high iOS penetration), Android + Web later

**Recommendation:** Option A - Simultaneous launch. React Native significantly reduces iOS/Android duplication. Web app is necessary for desktop users (property managers doing accounting, reporting). Extra 4-6 weeks worth it to avoid fragmented user base.

---

### 10. Payment Processor

**Question:** Stripe only for MVP, or add GoCardless?
**Context:** Stripe supports UK card payments and bank transfers. GoCardless specializes in UK direct debit (better for recurring rent). GoCardless integration ~2 weeks additional dev.
**Options:**
- **Option A:** Stripe only for MVP (faster launch)
- **Option B:** Stripe + GoCardless in MVP (better UK payment support)
- **Option C:** Stripe for MVP, GoCardless in Phase 2

**Recommendation:** Option C - Stripe only for MVP. GoCardless is valuable for recurring rent collection (direct debit), but can be added in Phase 2 after validating payment workflows. Stripe sufficient for MVP contractor payments and one-off rent payments.

## Next Steps for Product Owner

1. **Review this discovery document** with founder and stakeholders. Validate personas, workflows, and requirements.

2. **Make decisions** on the 10 open questions listed above (pricing, contractor accounts, tenant portal, etc.).

3. **Create comprehensive PRD** using this document as foundation. Work section-by-section with founder to refine requirements.

4. **Prioritize user stories** for Sprint 1-6 (MVP development). Recommend starting with Epic 1 (Property Management) and Epic 2 (Work Orders) as foundation.

5. **Create wireframes** for core workflows:
   - Property manager mobile app: Home screen, property details, work order creation, photo upload
   - Contractor mobile app: Work order list, work order details, photo upload, status updates
   - Cleaner mobile app: Cleaning task checklist, photo upload, issue reporting
   - Web app: Property portfolio dashboard, calendar view, work order list, contractor database

6. **Conduct user research** (10-20 cabin/lodge owner interviews) to validate:
   - Workflow accuracy (does our proposed flow match their real-world process?)
   - Feature prioritization (which MVP features are truly must-haves?)
   - Pricing validation (will they pay Â£50-75/month for this?)

7. **Define acceptance criteria** in detail for each user story (see examples above, expand for all stories).

8. **Plan MVP beta testing** strategy (10-20 users, 2-month beta period, feedback collection process).
