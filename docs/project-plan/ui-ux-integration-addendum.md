# Project Plan - UI/UX Integration Addendum

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Project Manager:** John (PM Agent)
**Status:** Addendum to Sprint Plans based on UI Expert Review

---

## Executive Summary

After reviewing Sally's comprehensive UI/UX specification (`docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md`), several adjustments are needed to the original sprint plans to account for design complexity and UX requirements. This addendum documents the changes and ensures successful collaboration between design and development workstreams.

---

## Key UX Findings Impacting Timeline

### 1. Design System Setup (Sprint 1 Impact)

**UX Specification Requirements:**
- React Native Paper (mobile) + Material-UI (web) component libraries
- Custom theme with design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Component library in Figma with variants and states
- Design tokens exported as JSON for developers

**Original Sprint 1 Estimate:** 8 hours for monorepo setup
**Revised Estimate:** **10 hours** (add 2 hours for design system integration)

**Added Tasks:**
- Import and configure React Native Paper theme
- Configure Material-UI theme with custom colors
- Create shared theme constants in `packages/shared/src/theme/`
- Test component rendering with custom theme

**Recommendation:** Developer should wait for Sally to export design tokens before finalizing theme configuration. Can use Material Design defaults temporarily.

---

### 2. Camera/Photo Capture Complexity (Sprint 3 & 5 Impact)

**UX Specification Requirements:**
- Fullscreen camera viewfinder with controls (flash toggle, flip camera, grid overlay)
- Photo preview with pinch-to-zoom
- AI quality check feedback UI (3 states: Good/Could be Better/Poor)
- Photo labeling picker (Before/During/After)
- High-contrast controls for outdoor use
- Haptic feedback on capture (iOS)

**Original Sprint 3 Estimate:** US-Mobile-8 (Camera Photo Upload) - 10 hours
**Revised Estimate:** **12 hours** (add 2 hours for complex UI states)

**Original Sprint 5 Estimate:** US-AI-2 (Photo Quality Check Warning) - 6 hours
**Revised Estimate:** **8 hours** (add 2 hours for feedback UI implementation)

**Total Impact:** +4 hours across Sprint 3 and 5

**Recommendation:**
- Sprint 3: Implement basic camera functionality (capture, preview, save)
- Sprint 5: Add AI quality check UI overlay and feedback states

---

### 3. Offline Sync UI Visibility (Sprint 4 Impact)

**UX Specification Requirements:**
- Persistent offline banner with 4 states (Offline/Syncing/Synced/Failed)
- Expandable sync queue screen showing pending items
- Progress indicators for sync operations
- Color-coded states with icons and messages
- Auto-dismiss banner after sync complete (3s)

**Original Sprint 4 Estimate:** Offline mode included basic sync queue - 56 hours total
**Revised Estimate:** **Add 4 hours** for comprehensive sync UI

**New Task: US-Offline-7 (4 hours):**
**As a** landlord
**I want** clear visibility into what's syncing and sync status
**So that** I trust the offline mode

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Persistent banner at top showing offline status
- [x] Banner has 4 visual states (colors, icons, messages)
- [x] Tap banner ‚Üí navigate to Sync Queue screen
- [x] Sync Queue screen shows: item type, status (pending/syncing/synced/failed), retry button
- [x] Banner auto-dismisses after successful sync (3s delay)

**Total Sprint 4 Revised:** 60 hours (was 56 hours)

---

### 4. Work Order Card Component (Sprint 2 Impact)

**UX Specification Requirements:**
- Color-coded left border (4pt) for priority
- Multiple states (default, hover, selected, offline pending, synced)
- Structured anatomy (header, metadata rows, footer)
- Truncation rules (2 lines max for title)
- "Overdue" badge if past due date

**Original Sprint 2:** Work order UI included in US-WO-2 (List Work Orders) - 5 hours
**Revised Estimate:** **6 hours** (add 1 hour for component states and polish)

---

### 5. Accessibility Implementation (All Sprints Impact)

**UX Specification Requirements:**
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- Screen reader support (VoiceOver, TalkBack)
- Keyboard navigation (web)
- Minimum touch target size (44x44pt iOS, 48x48dp Android)
- Color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements

**Impact:** Adds ~10% overhead to UI implementation tasks

**Recommendation:**
- Test with VoiceOver/TalkBack during Sprint 3-6 (not after launch)
- Add accessibility testing to Definition of Done for UI components
- Budget 2-3 hours per sprint for accessibility fixes

---

## Design-Development Coordination

### Parallel Workstream Required

**Critical:** Design work must start BEFORE development to avoid blocking developers.

**Recommended Timeline:**

```
Week 1-2 (Sprint 1): Design Foundation
‚îú‚îÄ Sally creates Figma workspace
‚îú‚îÄ Sets up component library (buttons, cards, forms)
‚îú‚îÄ Defines color palette and typography
‚îú‚îÄ Exports design tokens as JSON
‚îî‚îÄ Developer uses design tokens for theme setup

Week 3-4 (Sprint 2): Design Core Screens
‚îú‚îÄ Sally designs: Login, Properties List, Property Details, Create Work Order
‚îú‚îÄ Creates interactive prototypes for user testing
‚îú‚îÄ Developer implements Sprint 1 features (not blocked)
‚îî‚îÄ Weekly design review (Sally + PM + Developer)

Week 5-6 (Sprint 3): Design Mobile Screens
‚îú‚îÄ Sally designs: Camera/Photo flow, Work Order Details
‚îú‚îÄ Refines designs based on Sprint 2 feedback
‚îú‚îÄ Developer implements Sprint 2 features
‚îî‚îÄ Design handoff for Sprint 3 screens

Week 7-8 (Sprint 4): Design Offline UI

## Revised Sprint Capacity

### Sprint 1 (Week 1-2)
- **Original:** 50 hours
- **Revised:** 52 hours (+2 hours for design system setup)
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly over capacity (developer can work 2 extra hours or defer 1 small task)

### Sprint 2 (Week 3-4)
- **Original:** 50 hours
- **Revised:** 51 hours (+1 hour for work order card states)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Within capacity

### Sprint 3 (Week 5-6)
- **Original:** 53 hours
- **Revised:** 55 hours (+2 hours for camera UI complexity)
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly over capacity (consider deferring 1 story to Sprint 4)

### Sprint 4 (Week 7-8)
- **Original:** 56 hours
- **Revised:** 60 hours (+4 hours for sync UI visibility)
- **Status:** üö® Over capacity - **MUST ADJUST**

**Sprint 4 Mitigation Options:**
1. **Extend Sprint 4 by 2 days** (push Sprint 5 and 6 by 2 days each, launch Week 13 Day 2)
2. **Defer conflict resolution (US-Offline-6)** to Phase 2 (saves 6 hours, launch on time)
3. **Simplify sync UI** (skip Sync Queue screen, show banner only - saves 2 hours)

**Recommendation:** Option 2 - Defer conflict resolution to Phase 2. For MVP, last-write-wins is acceptable. Add comprehensive conflict resolution in Month 4-5 based on beta feedback.

### Sprint 5 (Week 9-10)
- **Original:** 42 hours
- **Revised:** 44 hours (+2 hours for AI feedback UI)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Within capacity

### Sprint 6 (Week 11-12)
- **Original:** 53 hours
- **Revised:** 53 hours (no change)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Within capacity

## Updated Risk Register

### New Risk: R14 - Design-Development Misalignment

**Category:** Process
**Impact:** Medium (delays sprints by 2-5 days if developer blocked)
**Probability:** Medium (30% without coordination)
**Risk Score:** ‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE

**Description:**
Developer starts implementing features before designs are ready, leading to:
- Rework when designs are finalized
- Developer blocked waiting for designs
- Inconsistent UI implementation (developer guesses design)

**Indicators:**
- Week 2: Design tokens not exported yet, developer using Material defaults
- Week 4: Developer implementing features without finalized designs
- Week 6: Developer requests design clarifications, Sally not responsive

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Design Ahead:** Sally designs screens 1-2 sprints ahead of development
2. **Weekly Sync:** Sally + Developer + PM meet every Monday (30 min design handoff)
3. **Figma Sharing:** Developer has view-only access to Figma, can inspect designs anytime
4. **Progressive Refinement:** Developer implements with Material defaults, Sally polishes in next sprint
5. **Design QA:** Sally reviews implemented designs weekly, logs polish items in GitHub

**Contingency Plan:**
- **Developer blocked on designs:** Implement with Material Design defaults, refine later
- **Sally unavailable:** PM provides design direction based on UX spec, Sally reviews asynchronously
- **Major design changes late:** Evaluate impact on timeline, consider deferring changes to Phase 2

**Owner:** PM
**Status:** Open
**Last Reviewed:** 2025-10-27
**Next Review:** Weekly (during Sprint 1-6)

---

## Updated Sprint 4 Plan (Recommended Adjustments)

### Deferred to Phase 2: US-Offline-6 (Conflict Resolution)

**Rationale:**
- Conflict resolution is edge case (rare for solo landlord to edit same work order on multiple devices simultaneously)
- Last-write-wins is acceptable for MVP (server version overwrites local)
- Can add sophisticated conflict resolution in Month 4-5 based on beta feedback
- Saves 6 hours in Sprint 4 (brings total from 60 hours ‚Üí 54 hours, within capacity)

**Updated Sprint 4 Capacity:**
- **Revised:** 54 hours (deferred US-Offline-6)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Within capacity (40-60 hours)

**Phase 2 Backlog:**
- Add US-Offline-6 (Conflict Resolution) to Month 4-5 iteration roadmap
- Implement if beta users report data conflicts (monitor during beta testing)
