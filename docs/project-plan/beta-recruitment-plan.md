## Target Audience Profile

### Ideal Beta User

**Demographics:**
- **Role:** Landlord or property manager
- **Portfolio Size:** 3-20 properties (sweet spot: 5-15)
- **Property Type:** Long-term let (6-12 month tenancies)
- **Location:** UK (any region, but Birmingham/Midlands preferred for local meetups)
- **Tech Savviness:** Comfortable with apps (uses Airbnb, WhatsApp, banking apps)

**Pain Points:**
- Frustrated with Arthur Online (reliability issues, outages, high price £60-120/month)
- Using spreadsheets or paper (time-consuming, error-prone)
- Struggling to track maintenance issues and contractor work
- Missing compliance deadlines (Gas Safety, Electrical certificates)
- Wasting 10-20 hours/week on manual coordination

**Motivation to Join Beta:**
- **Free access** for 6 months (saves £90-150)
- **Personal onboarding** (1:1 video call to help setup)
- **Direct line to founder** (influence product direction)
- **Early access** to Phase 2 features
- **Solving real pain** (genuinely want better maintenance tracking)

### Anti-Persona (Users to Avoid)

- **Tire-kickers:** Just curious, won't actually use the app
- **Non-landlords:** Real estate agents, contractors (different use case)
- **Large portfolios:** >50 properties (need enterprise features we don't have)
- **Short-term rentals only:** Airbnb hosts (different workflow, need Phase 2 STR features)
- **Not in UK:** Different compliance requirements, SMS costs high

## Contingency Plans

### Scenario 1: Low Signups (<10 by Week 12)

**Actions:**
1. **Expand Channels:** Post in more Facebook groups (UK Property Chat, Landlord Help UK)
2. **Referral Incentive:** Offer beta users +1 month free for each referral
3. **Lower Barrier:** Offer beta access without onboarding call (optional)
4. **Delay Launch:** Push to Week 13 to allow more recruitment time

---

### Scenario 2: High Signups but Low Activation (<50% create work order)

**Actions:**
1. **Personal Outreach:** Call each inactive user, offer hands-on help
2. **Simplify Onboarding:** Add in-app tutorial video (2 min)
3. **Incentivize:** "Create your first work order and get entered into raffle for £100 Amazon gift card"
4. **Diagnose:** Survey inactive users - why didn't you create work order? (too complex? no current maintenance issues? forgot password?)

---

### Scenario 3: High Churn (>50% users stop using after Week 1)

**Actions:**
1. **User Interviews:** Call churned users immediately - what went wrong?
2. **Fix Bugs:** Prioritize critical bugs reported by churned users
3. **Feature Gaps:** Identify must-have features missing (e.g., if all users ask for tenant portal, fast-track it)
4. **Re-engagement Campaign:** Email churned users when bugs fixed: "We fixed [X issue] you reported - give us another try?"

---

## Post-Beta: Transition to Paid (Month 6)

**Week 24 (Month 6):** Convert beta users to paying customers

**Tactics:**
1. **Early Bird Discount:** Email beta users - "£10/month for first 3 months (£5 off)"
2. **Lifetime Discount:** "As a thank you for being an early tester, you'll always pay £15/month (instead of £25/month for Pro)"
3. **Testimonial Exchange:** "Write a testimonial and get 3 months free"
4. **Grandfather Clause:** "Your free 6 months extended to 12 months if you invite 3 landlord friends"

**Expected Conversion:** 50-70% of active beta users (7-14 paying customers from 15-20 beta users)
