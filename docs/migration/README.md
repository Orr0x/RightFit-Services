## For Future Reference

If considering future major version upgrades:

1. **Read** [archive/TECH_STACK_EVALUATION.md](archive/TECH_STACK_EVALUATION.md) - Learn from mistakes
2. **Follow** [archive/MIGRATION_PLAN.md](archive/MIGRATION_PLAN.md) pattern - Proven approach
3. **Document** as ADR in [docs/architecture.md](../architecture.md)
4. **Validate** ecosystem compatibility before adopting bleeding-edge versions
5. **Budget** time for migration properly (use 1.5x estimate)
