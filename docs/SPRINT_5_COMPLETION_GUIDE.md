---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Migration (10 min)

**Prerequisites:**
- Stop all running servers (API, web dev server)
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running

```bash
# 1. Stop API server
# Find the process on port 3001
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
# Kill the process (replace PID with actual process ID)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# 2. Navigate to database package
cd packages/database

# 3. Generate Prisma client with new models
npx prisma generate

# 4. Create and apply migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_push_notifications

# Expected output:
# ✓ Migration created successfully
# ✓ Applied migration: add_push_notifications
# ✓ Generated Prisma Client

# 5. Verify migration
npx prisma migrate status
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (5 min)

```bash
# Return to project root
cd ../..

# Install all new dependencies
pnpm install

# Expected output:
# Already up to date
# (pnpm will install @sendgrid/mail, axios, expo-notifications, expo-device)
```

### Step 3: Configure Resend Email Service ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** ✅ Already configured and tested

1. **Resend Account Setup** ✅
   - Free tier: 3,000 emails/month (30x more than SendGrid free tier)
   - Account created at: https://resend.com

2. **API Key Configuration** ✅
   - API key obtained and configured
   - Environment variables set in `apps/api/.env`

3. **Environment Variables** ✅ Added

```env
# Resend Email Service (Migrated from SendGrid)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_4VkDq5cK_4cJA51LPD8ANs9sqpYZTZNod
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
```

4. **Twilio SMS Configuration** ✅ Added

```env
# Twilio SMS Service
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+447723472092
```

5. **Mobile Photo Viewing** ✅ Fixed

```env
# API Base URL for mobile app photo access
API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.0.17:3001
```

**Migration Notes:**
- **Migrated from SendGrid to Resend** on 2025-10-29
- Reason: SendGrid free trial ended, requiring payment for 0 emails/month
- Resend offers 3,000 emails/month free (vs SendGrid's $19.95/month Essentials plan)
- Migration completed successfully with no downtime
- Email templates and functionality preserved

### Step 4: Test Email Notifications ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** ✅ Successfully tested with real certificate data

**Test 1: Certificate Expiring in 30 Days** ✅ Passed

```bash
# Created test certificate expiring 2025-11-28 (30 days from 2025-10-29)
# Certificate Type: Gas Safety Certificate
# Property: home (123 Straiton Road, Burton-on-Trent)

# Triggered manual notification check
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/test-notification
```

**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
- Email received in Gmail inbox (jamesrobins9@gmail.com)
- Subject: "Certificate Expiry Alert"
- Beautiful HTML formatting with purple gradient header
- Orange "EXPIRING SOON" badge (correct for 30-day warning)
- Certificate details displayed correctly:
  - Certificate Type: Gas Safety Certificate
  - Property: home
  - Expiry Date: 28 November 2025
  - Status: Expires in 30 days
- Professional email template with:
  - Call-to-action button: "View Certificate Details"
  - Educational content about UK compliance requirements
  - Support contact information

**Email Service Performance:**
- Delivery time: <2 seconds
- HTML rendering: Perfect across Gmail
- Mobile responsive: Yes
- Links functional: Yes

### Step 5: Configure Push Notifications (30 min)

**Mobile App Implementation Required:**

You need to implement the following in the mobile app:

1. **Create Notification Service** ([apps/mobile/src/services/notificationService.ts](apps/mobile/src/services/notificationService.ts))

```typescript
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications'
import * as Device from 'expo-device'
import api from './api'

// Configure notification handler
Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldShowAlert: true,
    shouldPlaySound: true,
    shouldSetBadge: true,
  }),
})

export async function registerForPushNotifications() {
  if (!Device.isDevice) {
    console.log('Push notifications only work on physical devices')
    return null
  }

  const { status: existingStatus } = await Notifications.getPermissionsAsync()
  let finalStatus = existingStatus

  if (existingStatus !== 'granted') {
    const { status } = await Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync()
    finalStatus = status
  }

  if (finalStatus !== 'granted') {
    console.log('Push notification permissions denied')
    return null
  }

  const token = (await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync({
    projectId: 'YOUR_EXPO_PROJECT_ID', // Get from app.json
  })).data

  // Register with backend
  await api.post('/api/devices/register', {
    push_token: token,
    device_id: Device.osInternalBuildId || Device.modelId,
    platform: Device.osName === 'iOS' ? 'IOS' : 'ANDROID',
  })

  return token
}

// Setup notification listeners
export function setupNotificationListeners() {
  // Foreground notification received
  Notifications.addNotificationReceivedListener((notification) => {
    console.log('Notification received:', notification)
    // Show in-app notification banner here
  })

  // User tapped notification
  Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener((response) => {
    const data = response.notification.request.content.data
    console.log('Notification tapped:', data)

    // Navigate to appropriate screen based on notification type
    if (data.deep_link) {
      // navigation.navigate(...)
    }
  })
}
```

2. **Call Registration on App Start** ([apps/mobile/App.tsx](apps/mobile/App.tsx))

```typescript
import { registerForPushNotifications, setupNotificationListeners } from './src/services/notificationService'

useEffect(() => {
  // Register for push notifications after login
  if (isAuthenticated) {
    registerForPushNotifications().then((token) => {
      console.log('Push token:', token)
    })
  }

  // Setup listeners
  setupNotificationListeners()
}, [isAuthenticated])
```

3. **Test Push Notifications**

```bash
# Send test push notification via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/send-test-notification \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "YOUR_USER_ID",
    "title": "Test Notification",
    "body": "This is a test push notification from RightFit Services"
  }'
```

**Expected Result:**
- Notification appears on device (foreground: banner, background: system tray)
- Tapping notification opens app
- Notification appears in in-app inbox

## Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Prisma Migration Locked

**Symptom:** `EPERM: operation not permitted` when running `prisma generate`

**Cause:** API server is running and has locked the Prisma client

**Fix:**
```bash
# Find API process
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

# Kill the process
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Retry migration
cd packages/database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_push_notifications
```

### Issue 2: Resend Email Not Received

**Symptom:** Email service logs success but email not in inbox

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Sender email not verified** → Check Resend dashboard
2. **Email in spam folder** → Check spam/junk
3. **Resend account issue** → Check Resend account status
4. **Daily send limit reached** → Free tier: 3,000 emails/month

**Fix:**
- Verify sender email/domain in Resend dashboard
- Check spam folder
- Check Resend email logs: Resend Dashboard → Emails

### Issue 3: Push Notifications Not Working in Expo Go

**Symptom:** Push token registration fails in Expo Go

**Cause:** Expo Go has limitations with push notifications

**Fix:**
- Use Expo Dev Client or production build:
```bash
# Build development client
cd apps/mobile
npx expo install expo-dev-client
npx expo run:android  # or run:ios
```
