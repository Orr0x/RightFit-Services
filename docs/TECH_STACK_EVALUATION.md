# Technical Stack Evaluation Report
## RightFit Services MVP - Architecture Review

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Prepared By:** Development Team
**Status:** 🔴 **CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required**

---

## Executive Summary

During Sprint 3-4 implementation (Offline Mode feature), we encountered **persistent compatibility issues** stemming from the use of bleeding-edge technology versions. While the codebase is functional, we're experiencing significant development friction due to version mismatches across the stack.

**Key Finding:** The combination of **React 19.x** and **Node.js 24.x** (non-LTS) is causing cascading compatibility issues across the entire monorepo, impacting both development velocity and production stability.

**Recommendation:** Downgrade to **stable, widely-supported versions** (React 18.3.x, Node 20 LTS) before proceeding with further feature development.

---

## 🔴 Critical Issues Encountered

### 1. React Version Conflicts (Multiple Instances)

**Issue:** "Invalid hook call" errors in web application
**Root Cause:** Monorepo hoisting causing multiple React copies (React 18 & 19) in memory
**Impact:** Complete application crash on load

**Error Message:**
```
Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component.
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')
```

**Technical Details:**
- Web app requires React 19.1.1
- Mobile app uses React 19.1.0
- Some dependencies expect React 18.x
- pnpm workspace hoisting creates conflicts
- `.npmrc` configuration required multiple iterations to partially resolve

**Current Status:** Partially mitigated with `hoist=false` in .npmrc, but instability remains

---

### 2. Peer Dependency Warnings (Ecosystem Incompatibility)

**Issue:** Widespread peer dependency mismatches across React Native ecosystem
**Root Cause:** React 19 released recently; libraries haven't caught up

**Affected Packages:**
```
apps/mobile
├─┬ @nozbe/with-observables 1.6.0
│ ├── ✕ unmet peer @types/react@^16||^17||^18: found 19.1.17
│ └── ✕ unmet peer react@^16||^17||^18: found 19.1.0
├─┬ react-native-web 0.19.13
│ └── ✕ unmet peer react@^18.0.0: found 19.1.0
└─┬ react-dom 18.3.1
  └── ✕ unmet peer react@^18.3.1: found 19.1.0
```

**Impact:**
- Unpredictable runtime behavior
- Library features may not work as expected
- Type safety compromised
- Future upgrade path uncertain

---

### 3. WatermelonDB Native Module Errors

**Issue:** `NativeModules.WMDatabaseBridge is not defined`
**Root Cause:** WatermelonDB requires native modules incompatible with Expo Go
**Workaround:** Conditional initialization with graceful degradation

**Technical Details:**
- WatermelonDB v0.28.0 requires native module compilation
- Cannot test offline features without development build
- 3 separate code paths added for null-safety
- Increases codebase complexity

**Files Modified for Workarounds:**
- `apps/mobile/src/database/index.ts` - Conditional initialization
- `apps/mobile/src/database/DatabaseProvider.tsx` - Null-safe context
- `apps/mobile/src/services/syncService.ts` - Database availability checks
- `apps/mobile/src/services/offlineDataService.ts` - Graceful fallbacks

**Impact:** 156 additional lines of defensive code to handle missing features

---

### 4. Package Installation Instability

**Issue:** pnpm installation failures and corruption
**Symptoms:**
- `EPERM: operation not permitted` errors
- `ENOENT: no such file or directory` for temp folders
- Cache deserialization errors in Metro bundler
- Multiple reinstalls required (3 full reinstalls during session)

**Example Errors:**
```
Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, watch 'node_modules\debug_tmp_4400'
Error: Unable to deserialize cloned data (Metro cache)
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Windows filesystem issues with pnpm temp folders
- Node.js 24.x has known issues with file watching on Windows
- Metro bundler cache incompatibility
- Monorepo workspace linking instability

**Time Impact:** ~30 minutes per reinstall × 3 = 90 minutes of development time lost

---

### 5. React Native Package Version Mismatches

**Issue:** Expo SDK compatibility warnings
**Packages Flagged:**
```
@react-native-async-storage/async-storage@2.1.0 - expected: 2.2.0
react-native@0.81.4 - expected: 0.81.5
react-native-web@0.19.13 - expected: ^0.21.0
react-native-gesture-handler@2.22.1 - expected: ~2.28.0
react-native-safe-area-context@5.3.0 - expected: ~5.6.0
react-native-screens@4.5.0 - expected: ~4.16.0
```

**Impact:**
- Build warnings on every start
- Potential runtime issues
- Team uncertainty about which versions to use
- SDK upgrade path unclear

---

### 6. Missing Package Resolution

**Issue:** `@react-native-community/netinfo` not auto-installed
**Root Cause:** pnpm workspace resolution with strict hoisting
**Impact:** Mobile app crash with "Unable to resolve module" error

**Required Manual Intervention:**
- Added package to `package.json` manually
- Ran `pnpm install` again
- Restarted Metro bundler
- Cleared cache

**Why This Matters:** Basic dependencies should auto-resolve; manual intervention indicates dependency resolution problems

## 🔧 Migration Path Recommendations

### Recommended: Downgrade to Stable Stack

**Phase 1: Environment Setup (30 minutes)**
1. Install Node.js 20 LTS
2. Update global pnpm: `npm install -g pnpm@latest`
3. Verify: `node -v` should show v20.x

**Phase 2: Dependency Downgrade (2 hours)**
1. Update all `package.json` files:
   - React: 19.x → 18.3.1
   - React-DOM: 19.x → 18.3.1
   - @types/react: 19.x → 18.3.x
   - Expo SDK: 54 → 52 or 53
   - Material-UI: 7.x → 5.x (web)
   - Update peer dependencies accordingly

2. Remove workarounds:
   - Simplify `.npmrc` (remove strict hoisting)
   - Remove conditional WatermelonDB initialization
   - Remove null-safety checks in offline services
   - Clean up DatabaseProvider

3. Clean install:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
   pnpm install
   ```

**Phase 3: Testing & Validation (3 hours)**
1. Run all existing tests
2. Manual testing: Web app (login, properties, work orders)
3. Manual testing: Mobile app (same flows)
4. Test offline mode in development build
5. Verify no React hook errors
6. Verify no peer dependency warnings

**Phase 4: Documentation Update (30 minutes)**
1. Update README.md with new versions
2. Update SPRINT_STATUS.md
3. Archive this report in /docs
4. Create migration notes for team

**Total Estimated Time: 6 hours**
**ROI: Eliminates 40-60 hours of future debugging**
