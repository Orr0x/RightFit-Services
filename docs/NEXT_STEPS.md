2. Subscription plans (Basic/Pro/Enterprise)
3. Billing dashboard
4. Production deployment setup

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks full-time work

---

## 📋 Immediate Action Items (This Week)

### Priority 1: Start Sprint 6 🔴 CRITICAL

**Task:** Implement Payment Processing
**Effort:** 40-60 hours
**Why Critical:** Can't launch without payments

**Steps:**
1. Create Stripe account (test mode first)
2. Design 3 subscription tiers:
   - Basic: £10/month (5 properties, 1 user)
   - Pro: £25/month (25 properties, 5 users)
   - Enterprise: £50/month (unlimited)

3. Implement Stripe in API:
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   pnpm add stripe
   ```

4. Create endpoints:
   - `POST /api/billing/checkout` - Start subscription
   - `POST /api/billing/portal` - Manage subscription
   - `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` - Handle Stripe events

5. Add billing dashboard to web app

6. Test payment flow end-to-end

### Priority 2: Choose Hosting 🟡 HIGH

**Task:** Decide where to deploy
**Effort:** 2-3 hours research
**Options:**

**Recommended: Vercel + Railway** (Easiest, $40/month)
- Vercel: Web + API ($20/month)
- Railway: PostgreSQL ($10/month)
- AWS S3: File storage ($5/month)
- Resend: Emails ($10/month for 10k emails)

**Alternative: DigitalOcean** (Middle ground, $60/month)
- App Platform: Web + API ($30/month)
- Managed PostgreSQL ($25/month)
- Spaces: S3 storage ($5/month)

**Enterprise: AWS** (Most control, $80+/month)
- More complex but scales better

### Priority 3: Security Hardening 🟡 HIGH

**Task:** Make API production-ready
**Effort:** 4-6 hours

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm add helmet express-rate-limit class-validator
```

Add to your API:
1. Helmet.js for security headers
2. Rate limiting on all endpoints
3. Request validation
4. Better error handling

## 💰 Budget Planning

### Monthly Operating Costs (MVP)

**Essential Services:**
- Hosting (Vercel + Railway): $40/month
- Sentry (error tracking): $26/month
- Resend (10k emails): $10/month
- Domain: $1/month ($12/year)
- **Subtotal: ~$77/month**

**Variable Costs:**
- Stripe fees: 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction
- Twilio SMS: £0.04 per message (optional)
- AWS S3: ~$5-20/month based on usage

**Total Estimated: $80-100/month** (excluding Stripe transaction fees)

### Break-Even Analysis
If you charge £25/month per customer:
- Need **4 customers** to cover costs
- Profit starts at customer #5

## 🔧 Quick Fixes (Optional, Can Do Today)

### Fix Remaining 4 Test Failures (~30 minutes)
The EmailService tests are failing due to mocking issues. Not critical, but nice to have 100% passing.

```bash
cd apps/api
# Look at the failing tests and adjust mocks
pnpm test
```

### Add Certificate Page to Mobile App (~2 hours)
Currently certificates only work in web app. Quick win to add to mobile.

### Test SMS Notifications (~15 minutes)
Twilio is configured but not tested. Quick test:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/test-sms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to": "+44YOUR_NUMBER", "message": "Test SMS"}'
```

## ❓ Questions You Might Have

### "Can I launch without payments?"
**No.** Without payments:
- You can't charge customers
- No revenue model
- Just a free tool with hosting costs

**Solution:** Sprint 6 is essential.

### "Can I skip the mobile app for now?"
**Maybe.** You could launch web-only:
- Pros: Faster to market
- Cons: Lose unique differentiator (offline mode)

**Recommendation:** Submit mobile apps for review during Week 3. Approval takes 1-2 weeks anyway.

### "What if I just want to test with friends first?"
**Great idea!** You can:
1. Skip Stripe integration temporarily
2. Deploy to production with just authentication
3. Manually add test users to database
4. Get feedback before building payments

**Then:** Add payments based on feedback.

### "How do I know if I'm ready?"
**Checklist:**
- ✅ Sprint 6 complete (payments working)
- ✅ Production environment configured
- ✅ SSL certificate installed
- ✅ Monitoring in place (Sentry)
- ✅ Legal documents published
- ✅ Mobile apps submitted
- ✅ Tested with 5+ beta users
- ✅ No critical bugs
