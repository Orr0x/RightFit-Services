## RightFit Services - PRD Generation Brief

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**From:** Business Analyst (Mary)
**To:** Product Owner (PO)
**Project:** RightFit Services - Property Maintenance SaaS Platform

---

## üéØ Your Mission

Create a **comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for RightFit Services MVP - a mobile-first property maintenance platform for UK landlords. You will translate business strategy and user needs into detailed, actionable requirements for the development team.

This is a **solo developer bootstrap project** with a **3-month timeline** and **minimal budget**, so your PRD must be:
- ‚úÖ **Crystal clear** (solo dev has no one to ask for clarification)
- ‚úÖ **Ruthlessly prioritized** (MVP scope only, no nice-to-haves)
- ‚úÖ **Detailed enough** to build from (specific acceptance criteria, edge cases documented)
- ‚úÖ **Flexible enough** to adapt (solo dev will discover better approaches during implementation)

---

## üìã Project Context (Read This First)

### What is RightFit Services?

A **reliable, mobile-native property maintenance platform** targeting UK landlords managing 1-50 long-term let properties.

**Core Problem We're Solving:**
- Current market leader (Arthur Online) has chronic reliability issues (multi-day outages, 3.8/5 rating, ¬£62.50-126/month)
- Landlords waste 10-20 hours/week on manual maintenance coordination (phone calls, texts, scattered photos)
- Existing platforms either lack mobile-first design (Landlord Vision desktop-only) or have limited features (Landlord Studio ¬£9/month but basic)

**Our Solution:**
"Arthur Online's features without the outages, at half the price (¬£15-25/month)"

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Rock-solid reliability** (99.5%+ uptime vs. Arthur Online's failures)
2. **True mobile-first** (native iOS/Android apps with offline mode)
3. **Basic AI photo quality checks** (unique at this price point)
4. **UK compliance tracking** (Gas Safety, Electrical, EPC certificate reminders)
5. **Competitive pricing** (¬£15-25/month vs. ¬£60-120 competitors)

### Target Users (Primary Persona)

**Tom - Independent Landlord (Age 42, 8 Properties)**

**Profile:**
- Owns 8 long-term let properties (flats and houses) in Midlands
- Tech-savvy (uses smartphone, online banking) but frustrated by complex software
- Currently uses Arthur Online (¬£75/month) but fed up with outages
- Does quarterly property inspections (needs mobile app to document issues on-site)
- Manages 3-4 trusted contractors (plumber, electrician, handyman, landscaper)

**Pain Points:**
- Arthur Online crashes during critical times (tenant emergency, can't create work order)
- Desktop-only platforms don't work during property inspections
- Scattered maintenance records (photos in phone, invoices in email, notes in notebook)
- Missed Gas Safety renewal deadline (almost got fined ¬£2,500)
- Spends 10+ hours/week playing phone tag with contractors

**Goals:**
- Save 8-10 hours/week on maintenance coordination
- Never miss compliance certificate renewal again
- Document all maintenance with photos (for insurance, disputes, property sales)
- Scale portfolio to 15-20 properties without losing his mind

**Jobs-to-Be-Done:**
1. **When** I'm inspecting a property, **I want to** create a work order and take photos on my phone, **so that** I document issues immediately before I forget
2. **When** I need a plumber urgently, **I want to** quickly assign a work order and send SMS notification, **so that** I don't waste time calling 3 contractors to find who's available
3. **When** my Gas Safety certificate is expiring, **I want to** receive automatic reminders 60 and 30 days early, **so that** I never risk fines or blocked evictions
4. **When** I'm working offline at a rural property, **I want to** create work orders that sync later, **so that** poor mobile signal doesn't prevent me from documenting issues
5. **When** a contractor finishes a repair, **I want to** see "after" photos automatically, **so that** I verify quality without driving to the property

### Business Model

- **UK-wide SaaS** (multi-tenant from day 1)
- **Subscription pricing:** ¬£15-25/month per landlord account
- **Free 30-day trial** (no credit card required to start)
- **Target revenue:** ¬£750-2,000 MRR by Month 6, ¬£4k-12.5k MRR by Month 12

---

## üö® Critical Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

### Solo Developer, 3-Month Timeline

- **ONE full-stack developer** building everything (React Native, Node.js, PostgreSQL)
- **12 weeks total** from start to MVP launch
- **No team** to delegate to, no designers, no QA (developer does everything)

**PRD Implications:**
- **No ambiguity allowed** - developer can't ask someone for clarification
- **Detailed acceptance criteria** - developer needs clear "definition of done"
- **Prioritized relentlessly** - every feature must justify its existence
- **Edge cases documented** - developer shouldn't have to guess error handling

### Minimal Budget (¬£2k-5k)

- No budget for custom design (use Material Design components out-of-the-box)
- No budget for expensive tools or services
- No budget for user research (validate with beta users after MVP)

**PRD Implications:**
- **No pixel-perfect mockups** - describe UX with component names (e.g., "Material-UI Card with TextField, Button")
- **Off-the-shelf components** - use React Native Paper, Material-UI (no custom design system)
- **Simple workflows** - avoid complex UX that requires custom interactions

### MVP Scope - What's IN

**10 Core Features (Week-by-Week Plan):**

1. **Property Management** - Create/edit properties, upload photos, list view
2. **Work Order Management** - Create/assign/track work orders with status workflow
3. **Mobile Apps (iOS + Android)** - React Native with offline mode
4. **Photo Upload + AI Quality Check** - Camera integration + Google Vision API
5. **Contractor Database** - Create/edit contractors, work history, internal ratings
6. **UK Compliance Tracking** - Certificate uploads, expiration reminders (Gas Safety, Electrical, EPC)
7. **Basic Web App** - React web with core features (mobile-responsive)
8. **Authentication & Multi-Tenancy** - Signup/login, JWT, tenant isolation
9. **Payment & Subscription** - Stripe integration, ¬£15-25/month plans, 30-day trial
10. **Deployment & Monitoring** - AWS infrastructure, CI/CD, error tracking

### MVP Scope - What's OUT

‚ùå **Tenant portal** (Phase 2) - Low adoption (19% UK), build after landlord validation
‚ùå **Payment processing for rent** (Phase 2) - Just track manually for MVP
‚ùå **Cleaning coordination** (Phase 2) - STR-specific, not needed for long-term landlords
‚ùå **Calendar/booking management** (Phase 2) - Manual entry sufficient for MVP
‚ùå **Contractor marketplace** (Phase 2) - Two-sided complexity, wait until demand proven
‚ùå **Advanced reporting** (Phase 2) - Basic lists sufficient for MVP
‚ùå **Document storage beyond certificates** (Phase 2) - Leases, inspection reports later
‚ùå **In-app messaging** (Phase 2) - Use SMS/email for MVP
‚ùå **Advanced AI** (Phase 2) - Custom models, damage estimation later
‚ùå **Channel integrations** (Phase 3) - Airbnb, Booking.com APIs not needed for long-term market
‚ùå **MTD HMRC integration** (Phase 3) - Deadline April 2026, time to build later

## üì¶ Your Deliverables

Please create a comprehensive PRD with the following sections:

### 1. Product Overview (HIGH PRIORITY)

**What to include:**
- Product vision (1-2 paragraphs)
- Target users (Tom persona from above)
- Core value proposition
- Success metrics (MVP success criteria)

**Reference:** `docs/brief.md` - Executive Summary and Target Users sections

### 2. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria (HIGH PRIORITY - MOST IMPORTANT)

**For EACH of the 10 core features, write user stories with:**

**Format:**
```
**Epic: Property Management**

**US-1.1: Create Property Profile**
As a landlord,
I want to create a property profile with address and basic details,
So that I can organize my portfolio and track maintenance per property.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can access "Add Property" button from properties list screen
- [ ] Form includes fields: Property name (required, max 100 chars), Street address (required), City (required), Postcode (required, UK postcode validation), Property type (dropdown: Flat, House, HMO, Other), Bedrooms (number, optional), Bathrooms (number, optional)
- [ ] User can save property ‚Üí navigates back to properties list with success message "Property created"
- [ ] Property appears in properties list immediately (no refresh needed)
- [ ] Validation errors show inline (e.g., "Postcode is invalid" under postcode field)
- [ ] If save fails (network error), show error message "Failed to save property. Please try again."

**Edge Cases:**
- [ ] User enters invalid postcode (e.g., "12345") ‚Üí validation error "Invalid UK postcode format"
- [ ] User leaves required fields empty ‚Üí can't submit, error "This field is required"
- [ ] Network error during save ‚Üí show error, allow user to retry (don't lose form data)
- [ ] Duplicate property name ‚Üí allow it (landlords may have multiple "Flat 1")

**Mobile UX Notes:**
- Use React Native Paper TextInput components (outlined variant)
- Use React Native Paper Dropdown for property type
- Use React Native Paper Button (contained mode) for "Save Property"
- Keyboard should auto-advance to next field on Enter (except last field)
- Show loading spinner on button during save

**API Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/v1/properties`
- Request body: `{ "name": "Flat 1A", "street_address": "123 High St", "city": "Birmingham", "postcode": "B1 1AA", "property_type": "Flat", "bedrooms": 2, "bathrooms": 1 }`
- Response: `{ "data": { "id": "uuid", "name": "Flat 1A", ... }, "meta": {} }`
```

**Write stories for ALL 10 features this way.**

**Priority features (write these first):**
1. Property Management (3-5 user stories)
2. Work Order Management (8-10 user stories - this is the core feature)
3. Mobile Apps - Offline Mode (5-7 user stories - critical differentiator)
4. Photo Upload + AI Quality (4-6 user stories)
5. Contractor Database (4-5 user stories)
6. UK Compliance Tracking (3-4 user stories)

**Lower priority (less detail needed):**
7. Basic Web App (reference mobile stories, note differences)
8. Authentication (standard patterns, 2-3 stories)
9. Payment & Subscription (Stripe standard flow, 2-3 stories)
10. Deployment (developer will handle, just list requirements)

### 3. Data Models & Relationships (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Define core entities:**

**Example format:**
```
**Property Entity**
- id: UUID (primary key)
- tenant_id: UUID (foreign key to users table - multi-tenancy)
- name: String (max 100 chars, required)
- street_address: String (max 200 chars, required)
- city: String (max 100 chars, required)
- postcode: String (UK postcode format, required)
- property_type: Enum (Flat, House, HMO, Other)
- bedrooms: Integer (optional)
- bathrooms: Integer (optional)
- created_at: Timestamp
- updated_at: Timestamp
- deleted_at: Timestamp (soft delete)

**Relationships:**
- Belongs to: User (landlord, via tenant_id)
- Has many: WorkOrders
- Has many: Certificates
- Has many: Photos (property photos)
```

**Entities to define:**
- User (landlords, contractors)
- Property
- WorkOrder
- Contractor
- Certificate
- Photo
- Subscription (Stripe data)

**Note:** Architect will design the full schema, but you should specify business logic requirements (e.g., "soft deletes required for audit trail", "work orders must track status change history")

### 4. Workflows & User Flows (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Document 3-5 critical workflows:**

**Example:**

**Workflow: Create Work Order from Mobile During Property Inspection**

**Actors:** Landlord (Tom)
**Trigger:** Tom inspects property, finds broken window lock
**Preconditions:** Tom is logged in, has properties in system

**Happy Path:**
1. Tom opens RightFit mobile app
2. Taps "Properties" tab ‚Üí sees list of his 8 properties
3. Taps "Flat 1A" ‚Üí property details screen
4. Taps "New Work Order" button
5. Work order form appears:
   - Property: Pre-filled "Flat 1A" (readonly)
   - Title: Tom types "Replace broken window lock"
   - Priority: Tom selects "Medium"
   - Category: Tom selects "Locks & Security"
   - Description: Tom types "Bedroom window lock won't close properly, needs replacement"
   - Photos: Tom taps "Add Photo" ‚Üí camera launches ‚Üí Tom takes 2 photos of broken lock
   - Due date: Tom selects "2025-11-10" (2 weeks from now)
   - Assign contractor: Tom selects "John Smith - Handyman" from dropdown
6. Tom taps "Save Work Order"
7. App shows loading spinner (2 seconds)
8. Success message: "Work order created and John Smith notified via SMS"
9. App navigates back to property details, work order appears in "Active Work Orders" section
10. John Smith receives SMS: "New work order assigned: Replace broken window lock at Flat 1A, 123 High St. Priority: Medium. View details in RightFit app."

**Offline Variant:**
- Step 1-6 same as above
- Step 7: App detects no internet connection, shows "Offline Mode" banner at top
- Step 8: App saves work order to local database + sync queue
- Step 9: Success message: "Work order saved offline. Will sync when you're back online."
- Step 10: Work order appears in list with "Pending sync" indicator (cloud icon with up arrow)
- Later: Tom gets back to office, phone reconnects to WiFi
- App automatically syncs: uploads photos to S3, creates work order via API, sends SMS to contractor
- "Pending sync" indicator disappears, work order now shows "Assigned" status

**Edge Cases:**
- Photo quality check fails (too dark) ‚Üí warn Tom, let him proceed anyway
- Contractor doesn't have SMS number in system ‚Üí show warning, work order created but no SMS sent
- Save fails (network error) ‚Üí show error, allow retry
- Tom changes his mind before saving ‚Üí back button prompts "Discard work order?" with Cancel/Discard options

**Write workflows for:**
1. Create work order from mobile during property inspection (above)
2. Contractor receives work order, updates status, uploads "after" photos
3. Offline work order creation and sync when online
4. Certificate expiration reminder flow (notification ‚Üí upload new certificate)
5. Landlord assigns work order to contractor (SMS sent automatically)

### 5. UI/UX Component Specifications (LOW PRIORITY - Keep Simple)

**You don't need detailed mockups, just describe components:**

**Example:**

**Properties List Screen (Mobile)**

**Components:**
- Header: Material AppBar with title "My Properties", search icon (right), hamburger menu (left)
- Search bar: TextInput with search icon, placeholder "Search properties..."
- List: FlatList (scrollable) with PropertyCard components
  - PropertyCard: Material Card with:
    - Property photo (left, 80x80px, rounded corners)
    - Property name (heading, bold)
    - Address (body text, gray)
    - Badge showing active work order count (right, if >0, red background)
    - Right chevron icon
  - Tap card ‚Üí navigate to Property Details screen
- Floating Action Button (FAB): Bottom right, "+" icon, tapping opens "Add Property" screen
- Empty state: If no properties, show illustration + text "No properties yet. Tap + to add your first property"

**Properties List Screen (Web)**

**Components:**
- Same as mobile but adapt for desktop:
  - Header: TopNav with logo (left), "Properties" active tab, user menu (right)
  - Search bar: Top right of content area
  - List: Grid layout (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet) instead of vertical list
  - PropertyCard: Same design but larger (200x150px image)
  - Add Property: Button in top right (not FAB)

**Write component specs for:**
1. Properties List (mobile + web)
2. Work Orders List (mobile + web)
3. Work Order Details (mobile + web)
4. Create/Edit Work Order Form (mobile + web)
5. Contractor List (mobile + web)

**Use component names from:**
- Mobile: React Native Paper (https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/)
- Web: Material-UI (https://mui.com/material-ui/)

### 6. API Requirements (LOW PRIORITY - Architect will design, but note business logic)

**For each major feature, note:**
- Required endpoints (REST: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Business logic (e.g., "When work order assigned, send SMS via Twilio API")
- Validation rules (e.g., "UK postcode must match regex pattern")
- Error handling (e.g., "If SMS send fails, still create work order but log error")

**Example:**

**Work Orders API Requirements**

**Endpoints needed:**
- `GET /api/v1/work-orders` - List work orders with filters
- `POST /api/v1/work-orders` - Create work order
- `GET /api/v1/work-orders/:id` - Get work order details
- `PUT /api/v1/work-orders/:id` - Update work order
- `DELETE /api/v1/work-orders/:id` - Soft delete work order
- `POST /api/v1/work-orders/:id/assign` - Assign contractor (triggers SMS)

**Business Logic:**
- When work order created with contractor assigned ‚Üí send SMS via Twilio immediately
- SMS format: "New work order assigned: {title} at {property_name}, {property_address}. Priority: {priority}. View in RightFit app."
- If SMS send fails ‚Üí log error, but don't fail work order creation
- Work order status transitions: Open ‚Üí Assigned ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed (no backwards transitions except via admin)
- Only landlord who owns property can create work orders for that property (tenant isolation)
- Contractors can only view work orders assigned to them, can update status and add photos, cannot delete

**Validation Rules:**
- Title: Required, 1-100 characters
- Priority: Required, enum (Emergency, High, Medium, Low)
- Property: Required, must belong to landlord's tenant
- Contractor: Optional (can be assigned later), must exist in landlord's contractor database
- Due date: Optional, must be future date if provided
- Photos: Max 5 photos per work order, max 5MB each, formats: JPG, PNG

### 7. Offline Mode Requirements (HIGH PRIORITY - This is Critical)

**Specify offline behavior for:**

**Work Orders:**
- User can create work orders offline ‚Üí saved to local DB + sync queue
- User can view existing work orders offline (cached data)
- User can add photos offline ‚Üí stored locally
- When online, sync queue processes: upload photos to S3 ‚Üí create work order via API ‚Üí remove from queue on success
- If sync fails (e.g., 404 property deleted on server) ‚Üí show error to user, allow discard or retry

**Properties:**
- User can view properties offline (cached)
- User cannot create properties offline (acceptable limitation - not common during inspections)

**Photos:**
- Photos taken offline stored in app's local storage (not user's camera roll)
- Photos compressed before upload (target: <2MB per photo)
- Upload progress shown (e.g., "Uploading 3 of 5 photos...")

**Sync Conflict Resolution:**
- Last-write-wins (server timestamp is source of truth)
- If user edits work order offline while someone else edits on server ‚Üí server version wins, user's changes discarded (acceptable for MVP, show warning)

**Offline Indicator:**
- Show "Offline Mode" banner at top of app when no connection
- Show sync status: "Syncing...", "Sync complete", "3 items pending sync"
- User can tap sync status to see queue details (optional for MVP)

### 8. UK Compliance Requirements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Certificate Types & Rules:**

**Gas Safety Certificate (CP12):**
- Required: Annually (every 12 months)
- Notification schedule: 60 days before expiration (push notification), 30 days before (push + email), 7 days before (push + email + SMS)
- Fields: Certificate number, Issue date, Expiration date (calculated: issue + 12 months), Contractor name, File (PDF or image)

**Electrical Safety Certificate:**
- Required: Every 5 years
- Notification schedule: Same as Gas Safety (60, 30, 7 days)
- Fields: Certificate number, Issue date, Expiration date (calculated: issue + 5 years), Contractor name, File

**EPC (Energy Performance Certificate):**
- Required: Every 10 years (for rental properties)
- Rating: A-G (dropdown)
- Notification schedule: 60, 30 days before expiration
- Fields: Certificate number, Rating (A-G), Issue date, Expiration date, File

**Scottish STL License (Optional - only for Scotland properties):**
- Required: Annually for short-term let properties in Scotland
- Fields: License number, Issue date, Expiration date, Local authority
- Notification schedule: 90, 60, 30 days before expiration (longer lead time due to application processing)

**Notification Delivery:**
- Push notification (mobile app)
- Email notification (backup)
- SMS notification (only for 7-day Gas Safety warning - most critical)

**User Actions:**
- View all certificates per property (list view with status indicators: Valid/Expiring/Expired)
- Upload new certificate (camera or file picker)
- Edit expiration date (if certificate scanned incorrectly)
- Dismiss notification (mark as "reminded")

### 9. Testing Scenarios (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Specify test cases for critical flows:**

**Example:**

**Test Scenario: Offline Work Order Creation and Sync**

**Setup:**
- User logged in
- User has 1 property in system ("Flat 1A")
- User has 1 contractor ("John Smith - Handyman") with phone +44 7700 900123
- User's device is online

**Test Steps:**
1. User turns on airplane mode (device offline)
2. User opens app ‚Üí sees "Offline Mode" banner
3. User navigates to "Flat 1A" ‚Üí taps "New Work Order"
4. User fills form: Title "Test offline", Priority "Medium", Contractor "John Smith", Takes 1 photo
5. User taps "Save" ‚Üí sees "Work order saved offline" message
6. User sees work order in list with "Pending sync" indicator
7. User turns off airplane mode (device online)
8. User waits 5 seconds
9. User sees "Syncing..." toast notification
10. User sees "Sync complete" after 3 seconds
11. "Pending sync" indicator disappears from work order
12. John Smith receives SMS "New work order assigned: Test offline..."

**Expected Results:**
- Work order saved locally in step 5 ‚úì
- Work order persists after app closed and reopened (data not lost) ‚úì
- Sync triggers automatically when online (no manual "sync" button needed) ‚úì
- Photo uploaded to S3 successfully ‚úì
- Work order created on server via API ‚úì
- SMS sent to contractor ‚úì
- Local work order updated with server ID ‚úì

**Edge Cases to Test:**
- App crashes during offline save ‚Üí work order persists, appears in sync queue on relaunch
- Network error during sync ‚Üí retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 5 retries)
- Contractor deleted on server while work order in sync queue ‚Üí sync fails, show error "Contractor not found", allow user to reassign

**Write test scenarios for:**
1. Offline work order creation and sync (above)
2. Certificate expiration notification flow (60 days before ‚Üí 30 days before ‚Üí 7 days before)
3. Work order assignment SMS delivery (success and failure cases)
4. Photo AI quality check (too dark, too blurry, acceptable)
5. Multi-tenant isolation (User A cannot see User B's properties/work orders)

### 10. Non-Functional Requirements (LOW PRIORITY)

**Performance:**
- Mobile app load time: <2 seconds on 4G
- Photo upload: <5 seconds for 5MB image on 4G
- API response time: <500ms for 95% of requests
- Offline sync: Complete within 30 seconds when connection restored

**Reliability:**
- Uptime: 99.5%+ (track with UptimeRobot)
- Error rate: <1% of API requests fail
- Data durability: No data loss (offline queue persists through app crashes)

**Security:**
- HTTPS only (TLS 1.2+)
- Password hashing: bcrypt cost factor 12
- JWT tokens: 15-minute access token, 30-day refresh token
- Multi-tenant isolation: Users cannot access other tenants' data

**Scalability:**
- Support 500-1,000 users without major architecture changes
- Handle 10,000 work orders, 50,000 photos without performance degradation

**Usability:**
- Mobile-first design (thumb-friendly touch targets, >44px)
- Accessible (color contrast WCAG AA, screen reader support basic)
- Error messages clear and actionable ("Invalid postcode" not "Error 400")

## üìö Reference Documents

For full context, please read:

1. **`docs/brief.md`** - Complete project brief (strategy, market, MVP scope, constraints)
2. **`docs/po-discovery.md`** - Product discovery (personas, workflows, functional requirements) - **THIS IS YOUR PRIMARY REFERENCE**

---

## ‚ùì Questions You May Have

**Q: How detailed should acceptance criteria be?**
A: Very detailed. Solo developer needs to know exactly what "done" means. Include edge cases, error messages, validation rules.

**Q: Do I need pixel-perfect mockups?**
A: No. Describe UX with component names (React Native Paper, Material-UI). Developer will implement using standard components.

**Q: How do I prioritize user stories?**
A: Follow the week-by-week plan in `docs/brief.md` MVP Scope. Week 1-4 features are highest priority.

**Q: What if I'm unsure about technical feasibility?**
A: Document your requirement clearly, note your assumption, and flag it for architect/developer to review. (e.g., "Assuming Google Vision API can detect blurry photos with 80%+ accuracy - architect please validate")

**Q: Should I write stories for cut features (Phase 2)?**
A: No. Focus 100% on MVP features. Phase 2 stories can wait until after MVP launch.

**Q: How do I handle trade-offs (scope vs. timeline)?**
A: When in doubt, cut features. MVP is about minimal scope that delivers value. Better to launch with 8 solid features than 12 half-baked ones.
