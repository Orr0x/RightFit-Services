## Critical Path Stories

These 3 stories are on the critical path and MUST be completed:

1. **Story 007: Authentication & Multi-Tenancy**
   - Foundation for all other features
   - Multi-tenancy isolation is critical for security
   - All other stories depend on this

2. **Story 003: Offline Mode**
   - Key differentiator vs competitors
   - Highest technical complexity
   - Most risky feature - needs extensive testing

3. **Story 008: Payment Processing**
   - Required for launch (monetization)
   - Blocks revenue generation
   - Integration with Stripe must be complete

## Story File Structure

Each story file contains:

### Header
- Story number and title
- Epic classification
- Priority level
- Sprint allocation
- Story points estimate
- Current status

### User Story
- Standard format: "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"

### Acceptance Criteria
- Detailed AC with Given/When/Then format
- Technical specifications (API endpoints, UI components, validation)
- Complete enough for solo developer to implement without ambiguity

### Edge Cases
- Specific scenarios that need handling
- Expected behavior for each edge case

### Technical Implementation Notes
- API endpoint specifications with request/response examples
- Database models (Prisma schema)
- UI component examples (React Native Paper)
- Code snippets for complex logic

### Testing Checklist
- Manual testing steps
- Integration test scenarios
- Security tests (where applicable)

### Dependencies
- Blocked By: Stories that must be completed first
- Related: Stories that interact with this one
- Requires: External dependencies (libraries, services)

### Definition of Done
- Comprehensive checklist for story completion
- Includes: ACs met, tests written, code reviewed, deployed

## How to Use These Stories

### For Solo Developer

1. **Start with Sprint 1** (Stories 007 & 001)
   - Authentication is foundation for everything
   - Properties are required for work orders

2. **Work through sprints sequentially**
   - Each sprint builds on previous work
   - Dependencies are clearly marked

3. **Use story files as implementation guides**
   - API endpoints are fully specified
   - UI components have code examples
   - Database models are complete

4. **Check off items in Definition of Done**
   - Don't move to next story until current is 100% done
   - Each story is independently deployable

5. **Pay extra attention to:**
   - Story 003 (Offline Mode) - Highest complexity
   - Story 007 (Multi-Tenancy) - Security critical
   - Testing checklists - Don't skip tests

### For Product Owner (Sarah)

1. **Track progress** by updating story Status field
2. **Review completed stories** against Definition of Done
3. **Accept stories** only when all ACs met and tested
4. **Monitor risks** in Sprint 4 (Offline Mode)
5. **Adjust priorities** if needed (consult with developer first)

### For Stakeholders

- Each story is a deliverable unit of value
- Story points indicate complexity/effort (Fibonacci scale)
- Priority indicates business importance
- Sprint allocation shows delivery timeline
