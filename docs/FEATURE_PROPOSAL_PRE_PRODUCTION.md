## 3. Feature Recommendations

### 3.1 TENANT/RENTER FEATURES

#### Feature 1: Tenant Self-Service Portal ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem Statement:**
Tenants currently have no way to report maintenance issues, track repairs, or communicate with landlords. This creates friction, phone tag, and dissatisfaction.

**Proposed Solution:**
Build a simplified mobile app experience for tenants with core features:

1. **Submit Maintenance Requests**
   - Simple form: "What's broken?", "How urgent?", "Upload photo"
   - Auto-creates work order for landlord (status: OPEN)
   - Tenant receives confirmation: "Reported on Oct 29, 2025"

2. **Track Repair Progress**
   - Real-time status: Reported → Assigned → In Progress → Completed
   - Push notifications: "John (plumber) assigned to your request"
   - See BEFORE/AFTER photos when completed

3. **In-App Messaging**
   - Simple chat with landlord
   - Attach photos/videos
   - "Mark as urgent" button for emergencies

4. **Access Documents**
   - View tenancy agreement
   - See safety certificates (gas, electrical, EPC)
   - Emergency contact numbers always accessible

**User Flow:**
```
Tenant opens app → "Report Issue" → Select type (Plumbing/Electrical/etc.)
→ Take/upload photo → Describe problem → Submit
→ Landlord gets notification → Assigns contractor
→ Tenant sees: "John (plumber) will call you"
→ Work completed → Tenant sees BEFORE/AFTER photos → Rate experience
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Add `TENANT` role to User model
- New API route: `POST /api/tenants/invite` (landlord sends email invite)
- Simplified mobile app navigation for tenants (3 tabs: Issues, Messages, Documents)
- Magic link authentication (no password required initially)
- Notification preferences: Email, SMS, Push

**Business Value:**
- **Differentiation:** Only 15% of competitors offer this
- **Tenant retention:** Happy tenants stay longer (reduce void periods)
- **Reduced support burden:** Landlords spend less time on phone calls
- **Professional image:** "My landlord has an app!" vs "My landlord ignores texts"

**Effort Estimate:** 20 hours

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL - Huge competitive advantage

**Dependencies:**
- Feature 3 (Tenant Management System) must be implemented first
- Push notification infrastructure already exists ✅

**Risks:**
- Low technical risk (straightforward CRUD)
- UX risk: Must be VERY simple (tenants are not tech-savvy)

---

#### Feature 2: Tenant Satisfaction Surveys ⭐⭐⭐

**Problem Statement:**
Landlords have no visibility into tenant happiness until they give notice to leave. By then, it's too late.

**Proposed Solution:**
Automated surveys to measure tenant satisfaction and contractor performance.

1. **Post-Repair Survey** (auto-sent when work order status = COMPLETED)
   - "How satisfied are you with the repair?" (1-5 stars)
   - "Was it fixed properly?" (Yes/No/Partially)
   - "Was the contractor professional?" (1-5 stars)
   - Optional comment box

2. **Quarterly Check-ins** (cron job)
   - "How's everything with the property?"
   - "Any maintenance concerns?"
   - "How would you rate your landlord?" (anonymous)

3. **Landlord Dashboard**
   - Overall tenant satisfaction score: 4.6/5.0
   - Contractor performance: "John: 4.8⭐, Mike: 3.2⭐"
   - Identify unhappy tenants: "Sarah gave 2⭐ - follow up!"
   - Trends: "Satisfaction up 12% this quarter"

**User Flow:**
```
Work order completed → 24 hours later → Email to tenant
→ "How did we do?" → Click rating
→ Results saved → Landlord sees dashboard
→ "John has 4.8⭐ rating - use him more often"
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- New model: `Survey` (id, tenant_id, work_order_id, type, rating, comment, created_at)
- Email template with embedded rating links (Resend)
- Cron job: Send quarterly surveys
- Dashboard charts: Recharts library
- Average calculation service

**Business Value:**

**Effort Estimate:** 8 hours

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH

**Dependencies:**
- Feature 1 (Tenant Portal) should be implemented first
- Email notification system already exists ✅

---

#### Feature 3: Move-In/Move-Out Inspection Flows ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem Statement:**
Deposit disputes are common and contentious. "You damaged the carpet!" / "No, it was already stained!" Without evidence, it's he-said-she-said.

**Proposed Solution:**
Digital inspection process with photo evidence at move-in and move-out.

1. **Move-In Inspection**
   - Tenant walks through property with mobile app
   - Photo checklist: Kitchen, Bathroom, Living Room, Bedrooms, etc.
   - Mark any existing damage: "Scratch on kitchen counter (photo attached)"
   - Both parties digitally sign
   - PDF report generated and stored

2. **Move-Out Inspection**
   - Same process at move-out
   - Side-by-side comparison: "Move-in photo vs Move-out photo"
   - Auto-detect: "New damage: Hole in bedroom wall (photo comparison)"
   - Generate deposit deduction report
   - Email to tenant: "You owe £150 for wall repair"

3. **Dispute Resolution**
   - Clear evidence protects both parties
   - Photos timestamped and GPS-tagged
   - Accepted by Deposit Protection Schemes

**User Flow:**
```
Move-in day → Landlord opens app → "Start move-in inspection"
→ Walk through property → Take photos → Mark defects on floor plan
→ Tenant signs on phone → Landlord signs → PDF emailed to both
→ Move-out day → Same process → Compare photos
→ "Carpet damaged (£200 deduction)" → Tenant agrees/disputes
→ Submit to Deposit Protection Scheme with photo evidence
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- New model: `TenancyInspection` (id, tenancy_id, type [MOVE_IN/MOVE_OUT], photos[], defects[], signed_by_landlord, signed_by_tenant, pdf_url)
- Mobile checklist UI with camera integration

**Proposed Solution:**
Prominent emergency contact card and quick emergency reporting.

1. **Emergency Contact Card** (always visible in tenant app)
   - Landlord emergency number
   - 24/7 emergency plumber

   - Simple instructions with photos

**User Flow:**
```
Tenant: "Oh no, burst pipe!"
→ Opens app → Taps red "EMERGENCY" button
→ Selects: "Burst pipe" → Confirms
→ SMS sent to landlord + plumber

### 3.2 LANDLORD FEATURES

#### Feature 5: Financial Dashboard ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem Statement:**
Landlords ask: "Am I actually making money?" Currently, they must manually track income/expenses in Excel. At tax time, they scramble to find receipts. Many don't know which properties are profitable.

**Proposed Solution:**
Comprehensive financial tracking and reporting dashboard.

1. **Income Tracking**
   - Record monthly rent payments: "Oct 2025: £1,200 (Paid on Oct 1)"

   - **Portfolio-level summary:**
     - Total income: £5,400/mo
     - Total expenses: £1,800/mo
     - Net profit: £3,600/mo (67% margin)
   - **Charts:**

- Charts: Recharts library (React) or Chart.js
- CSV export: `json2csv` library
- Web + Mobile screens

**Business Value:**
- **Landlords' #1 request:** "I need to know if I'm profitable"
- **Differentiation:** Most competitors have poor/no financial tracking
- **Tax time value:** Worth the subscription price alone
- **Decision making:** "Should I sell Baker Street? It's losing money."
- **Upsell opportunity:** "Upgrade to Professional for multi-property comparison"

**Effort Estimate:** 15 hours

---

#### Feature 6: Tenant Management System ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Risks:** Low - straightforward CRUD

---

#### Feature 7: Work Order Templates & Bulk Operations ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem Statement:**
Landlords with 10+ properties waste time creating repetitive work orders. "Annual gas safety check" is the same for every property. Selecting properties one-by-one is tedious.

**Proposed Solution:**
Templates for common jobs and bulk actions.

1. **Work Order Templates**
   - Pre-filled templates:
     - "Annual Gas Safety Check" → Category: GAS, Priority: HIGH, Description: "Legal requirement..."

→ Select all properties (or check: "All properties")
→ Choose: "Create from template" → Select: "Annual Gas Safety Check"
→ Choose contractor: "John (Gas Safe registered)"
→ Set due date: "Dec 1, 2025"
→ Confirm → 10 work orders created instantly
→ John receives 1 SMS: "10 gas checks scheduled - see app for details"
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- New model: `WorkOrderTemplate` (id, tenant_id, title, description, category, priority, default_contractor_id, estimated_cost)
- API routes: `/api/work-order-templates`, `/api/work-orders/bulk-create`
- Bulk create endpoint: Accepts array of property IDs + template
- UI: Multi-select checkboxes on properties list

- **Power user feature:** Landlords with 20+ properties NEED this
- **Reduces errors:** Template ensures nothing forgotten
- **Professional:** "I'm efficient" vs "This is taking forever"

**Effort Estimate:** 8 hours (templates + bulk actions), +20 hours for recurring jobs

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH

**Dependencies:** None

Data-driven insights for strategic decision-making.

1. **Maintenance Cost Analysis**
   - Per property: "Springfield House: £1,200/year maintenance"
   - Compare: "Baker Street: £4,500/year (problem property!)"
   - Trend: "Springfield costs increasing 15% YoY" (red flag)
   - Benchmark: "Average for 3-bed houses in this area: £1,800/year"

2. **Void Period Tracking**
   - Days vacant between tenancies: "Baker Street: 45 days void in 2024"
   - Lost income: "45 days × £40/day = £1,800 lost"
   - Portfolio vacancy rate: "5% (below UK average of 8% - well done!)"

3. **Time-to-Repair Metrics**
   - Average resolution time: "Work orders resolved in 4.2 days"
   - By contractor: "John: 2.1 days average, Mike: 7.3 days (slow!)"
   - By priority: "High priority: 1.5 days, Medium: 4 days, Low: 8 days"
   - Trend: "Response time improving 12% this quarter"

4. **Certificate Compliance Score**
   - Traffic light system: "4/5 properties compliant" (1 certificate expiring soon)
   - Risk level: "LOW" (all critical certs valid) or "HIGH" (expired certs)

**User Flow:**
```
Landlord opens Analytics page

      "Compliance: 80% (1 cert expiring)"
      "Verdict: Consider selling - money pit"
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Analytics calculation service:
  - Maintenance cost = SUM(work_orders.actual_cost) per property per year
  - Void days = Days between tenancy end_date and next start_date
  - Time-to-repair = AVG(completed_at - created_at) for work orders
  - Compliance = % of certificates with expiry_date > today

---

#### Feature 10: Contractor Reputation System ⭐⭐⭐

**Problem Statement:**
No way to track contractor performance. Good contractors deserve more work. Bad contractors should be replaced. Currently, landlord has no data.

**Proposed Solution:**
Rating and reputation system with badges.

1. **Contractor Profile Page**
   - Overall rating: 4.7⭐ (based on landlord + tenant surveys)
   - Jobs completed: 127 lifetime
   - Jobs this month: 8
   - Average time to complete: 2.3 days

### 3.4 LETTING AGENT FEATURES

#### Feature 11: Multi-Landlord Management ⭐⭐⭐

**Problem Statement:**
Letting agents manage properties for 10-50 different landlord clients. Current system requires separate account per landlord. Agent would need to log in/out 50 times per day. Unusable.

**Proposed Solution:**
"Agency mode" where one agent account can manage multiple landlord clients.

1. **Agent Account Structure**
   - Agent creates ONE account (role: AGENT)
   - Add landlord clients: "Add client: John Smith (8 properties)"
   - Each client = separate sub-account (behind the scenes: separate tenant_id)
   - Client switcher dropdown: "Currently viewing: John Smith's properties"

2. **Landlord-Specific Views**
   - Filter everything by current client:
     - Properties → Show only John Smith's 8 properties
     - Work orders → Only John's work orders
     - Financials → Only John's income/expenses
   - Switch client: Dropdown changes to "Sarah Jones" → See Sarah's 12 properties

3. **Landlord Reporting**
   - Auto-generate monthly PDF report per client
   - "John Smith - October 2025 Report"
     - Properties managed: 8
     - Work orders completed: 12
     - Total maintenance costs: £2,340
     - All certificates compliant ✓
     - Tenant satisfaction: 4.6/5 ⭐
   - Email report automatically (or download)

4. **Permission Levels**
   - Agent: Full control over all client accounts
   - Landlord (invited): View-only OR limited edit (configurable)
     - Landlord can log in to see their own properties
     - Agent decides: "John can view but not edit" or "John can create work orders"
   - Separation: Landlord A cannot see Landlord B's data

**User Flow:**
```
Agent logs in → Dashboard shows: "You manage 35 landlords, 247 properties"
→ Dropdown: "View client: John Smith (8 properties)"
→ Everything filters to John's data only
→ Create work order for John's property → Assign contractor
→ End of month → Click "Generate reports for all clients"
→ 35 PDF reports generated and emailed
→ John receives: "Your October report is ready"
→ John logs in (separate login) → Sees only his 8 properties (read-only)
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Major architecture change:**
  - Add `AgentClient` model (id, agent_tenant_id, client_tenant_id, client_name, permission_level)
  - Add `role` to User: ADMIN, MEMBER, CONTRACTOR, AGENT, LANDLORD_CLIENT
  - Middleware: If role=AGENT, filter queries by currently selected client_tenant_id
  - Session stores: current_client_tenant_id
- New API routes:
  - `POST /api/agent/clients` (add new landlord client)
  - `GET /api/agent/clients` (list all clients)
  - `PUT /api/agent/switch-client/:id` (change current client view)
- Client switcher UI component (dropdown in header)
- Report generation: Loop through all clients, generate PDF for each (reuse existing report logic)
- Permission system: Check if landlord_client has edit permissions

**Business Value:**
- **New market segment:** Letting agents (10-50 properties per agent)
- **Higher LTV:** Agents manage more properties = more revenue
- **Sticky:** Hard to switch platforms if managing 50 landlords
- **Premium tier:** Charge more for agency features (£50-100/month)

**Effort Estimate:** 35 hours (complex architectural change)

**Priority:** ⭐⭐ MEDIUM (implement post-launch when agents express interest)

**Dependencies:**
- Major refactor of multi-tenancy architecture
- Test thoroughly to ensure data isolation (CRITICAL - security risk if broken)

**Risks:**
- **HIGH RISK:** Data leakage between clients (John sees Sarah's properties)
- **Mitigation:** Extensive testing, row-level security, audit log

---

#### Feature 12: Viewing Management System ⭐⭐

**Problem Statement:**
Letting agents schedule 5-10 property viewings per week. Currently manual: Phone calls, text confirmations, no-shows (20-30% of viewings).

**Proposed Solution:**
Self-service viewing booking with automated reminders.

1. **Viewing Scheduler**
   - Agent sets available time slots: "Monday 2pm, Tuesday 10am, Tuesday 4pm"
   - Generate public booking link: "https://rightfit.app/viewings/property-123"
   - Prospective tenant clicks link → Sees available slots → Books viewing
   - Auto-confirmation email: "Your viewing at 123 Main St on Tuesday 2pm is confirmed"

2. **Viewing Calendar**
   - Calendar view showing all scheduled viewings
   - Color-coded by property
   - Click viewing → See: Prospect name, phone, email, notes
   - "Send directions" button → SMS with Google Maps link

3. **Automated Reminders**
   - 24 hours before: Email + SMS reminder to prospect
   - 1 hour before: SMS reminder to prospect + agent
   - Reduces no-shows significantly

4. **Post-Viewing Follow-up**
   - After viewing time: "Did Sarah attend?" (Yes/No/No-show)
   - If Yes: "Interest level?" (High/Medium/Low)
   - If High: Auto-send email: "Thanks for viewing. Next steps to apply..."
   - Track: "8 viewings this month, 6 attended, 2 applications"

**User Flow:**
```
Agent lists property → Click "Enable viewings"
→ Set available times → Generate link
→ Share link on Rightmove ad
→ Prospect clicks → Books Tuesday 2pm
→ Both receive confirmation
→ Monday: Reminder emails sent
→ Tuesday 1pm: SMS reminders
→ Tuesday 2pm: Viewing happens
→ Tuesday 2:30pm: Agent marks: "Attended, high interest"
→ Auto-email: "Thanks for viewing. Apply here: [link]"
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- New models:
  - `PropertyViewing` (id, property_id, prospect_name, prospect_email, prospect_phone, scheduled_at, status [SCHEDULED/COMPLETED/NO_SHOW/CANCELLED], interest_level, notes)
- Public booking page (no login required): React form
- Calendar UI: FullCalendar library or React Big Calendar
- Reminder cron job: Check for viewings in next 24 hours / 1 hour
- Email + SMS notifications (Resend + Twilio) ✅

**Business Value:**
- **Time saver:** Automate 70% of viewing admin work
- **Reduce no-shows:** Reminders cut no-shows from 30% to 10%
- **Professional image:** "Book online" vs "Call me"
- **Data tracking:** "Which properties get most viewing requests?"

**Effort Estimate:** 15 hours

**Priority:** ⭐⭐ MEDIUM (post-launch, if agents request)

**Dependencies:** None

- **Investor confidence:** "Our portfolio is well-managed"

**Effort Estimate:** 20 hours

**Priority:** ⭐⭐ MEDIUM (post-launch, for enterprise customers)

**Dependencies:**
- Feature 5 (Financial Dashboard) provides some underlying data

---

#### Feature 14: Automated Compliance Tracking ⭐⭐⭐

**Problem Statement:**
One non-compliant property = £30,000 fine (UK law). Management companies need early warning system and automated scheduling.

**Proposed Solution:**
Proactive compliance management with escalation.

1. **Compliance Traffic Light Dashboard**
   - **Green (347 properties):** All certificates valid >30 days
   - **Amber (12 properties):** Certificates expiring within 30 days
   - **Red (5 properties):** Certificates expired or expiring within 7 days
   - Click any color → See list of properties

2. **Automated Work Order Creation**
   - 60 days before expiry: Auto-create work order "Gas Safety Check Due - 123 Main St"
   - Assign to preferred contractor automatically
   - Set priority: HIGH
   - Set due date: 30 days before expiry (buffer time)

3. **Escalation Workflow**
   - **60 days before expiry:**
     - Create work order
     - Email property manager: "Gas cert expiring soon - work order created"
   - **30 days before expiry:**
     - Email landlord + property manager
     - SMS to contractor if not yet scheduled
   - **7 days before expiry:**
     - RED ALERT email to director
     - Push notification to property manager
     - SMS to landlord: "URGENT: Gas cert expires in 7 days"
   - **Day of expiry:**
     - CRITICAL ALERT to director
     - Mark property as non-compliant
     - Optional: Block rent collection (legal requirement in some cases)

4. **Portfolio Compliance Certificate**
   - "Download compliance report for all properties" button

     - Property address
     - All certificates with expiry dates
     - Status: ✓ Compliant or ✗ Action needed
   - Used for:
     - Insurance renewals
     - Lender audits
     - Regulatory inspections

**User Flow:**
```
System: Daily cron job runs at 9 AM
→ Checks: Certificates expiring in 60 days
→ Finds: "123 Main St - Gas cert expires Dec 28, 2025" (60 days away)
→ Auto-creates work order: "Gas Safety Check Due"
→ Assigns: John (preferred gas engineer)
→ Emails property manager: "Work order created"
→ 30 days later: Email reminder
→ 7 days later: RED ALERT if still not completed
→ Property manager sees red alert → Calls contractor → Gets it done
→ Certificate uploaded → Status: Green ✓
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Compliance check cron job (daily at 9 AM UK time)
- Logic:
  ```javascript
  // Pseudo-code
  certificates = getCertificatesExpiringInDays(60);
  for (cert of certificates) {
    if (!hasOpenWorkOrder(cert.property_id, 'gas_safety_check')) {
      createWorkOrder({
        property_id: cert.property_id,
        title: `${cert.type} Check Due`,
        priority: 'HIGH',
        due_date: cert.expiry_date - 30 days,
        contractor_id: getPreferredContractor(cert.type)
      });
      sendEmail(propertyManager, 'Certificate expiring soon');
    }
  }
  ```
- Escalation notification logic (check 30 days, 7 days, 0 days)
- Traffic light calculation:
  - Red: expiry_date <= today + 7 days
  - Amber: expiry_date <= today + 30 days
  - Green: expiry_date > today + 30 days
- PDF report generation (reuse certificate list logic)

**Business Value:**
- **Risk mitigation:** Avoid £30,000 fines
- **Peace of mind:** "I'll never miss a renewal"
- **Insurance requirement:** Some insurers require proof of compliance tracking
- **Enterprise feature:** Management companies NEED this
- **Competitive advantage:** Most platforms have poor/no compliance tracking

**Effort Estimate:** 15 hours

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH (for enterprise customers)

**Dependencies:**
- Certificate tracking system already exists ✅

- 40% have good financial tracking, but not integrated with maintenance costs
- 0% have dedicated contractor mobile apps
- **Opportunity:** RightFit can be the ONLY affordable platform with full stakeholder coverage

### 8.2 User Research Quotes

**From initial market research (before development):**

> "I wish my tenants could just tell me what's broken instead of calling me at work."
> — Sarah, landlord with 6 properties

> "I have no idea if I'm actually profitable after all the repair costs."
> — Mike, landlord with 3 properties

> "My plumber keeps texting me 'What was that address again?' - so annoying."
> — Emma, landlord with 12 properties

> "I manage properties for 8 different landlords and have to use separate Excel spreadsheets for each one."
> — Letting agent, 45 properties

**These quotes directly inspired Features 1, 5, 9, and 11.**

### 8.3 Technical Architecture Notes

**Tenant Portal Authentication:**
- Option 1: Magic link (passwordless) - Easier for tenants, more secure
- Option 2: Email + password - More familiar, but tenants forget passwords
- **Recommendation:** Magic link for MVP, add password option later if requested

**Financial Dashboard Data Model:**
- Should we track every expense or just maintenance costs?
  - **Recommendation:** Start with maintenance (auto-imported from work orders) + manual expense entry
  - Phase 2: Add recurring expenses (insurance, utilities) with templates

**Multi-Landlord Architecture:**
- Current: 1 account = 1 tenant_id
- Proposed: 1 agent account can access multiple tenant_ids
- **Challenge:** Requires middleware to filter all queries by "current client"
- **Security:** Audit every query to prevent data leakage

### 8.4 Design Mockup Links

*To be added: Figma mockups for key screens*

- [ ] Tenant portal home screen
- [ ] Submit maintenance request flow
- [ ] Financial dashboard
- [ ] Work order template creation
- [ ] Contractor mobile app "My Jobs" view
